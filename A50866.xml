            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>JAcob</hi> having ju≈øt before his death, called all his Twelve Sons together, to ble≈øs them, and to tell them what ≈øhould happen both to them and to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in ≈øucceeding Ages, he preferred <hi>Judah</hi> (altho' not the Elde≈øt, but the Fourth Son) before the re≈øt of his Brethren, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him to the Throne, ≈øaying, Judah, <hi>thou art he whom thy brethren ≈øhall prai≈øe; thy hand ≈øhall be in the neck of thy enemies, and thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers children ≈øhall bow before thee.</hi> Judah <hi>is a Lions whelp: from the prey my ≈øon thou art gone up.

               <p>And after the return of the <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the de≈øtroying the <hi>Canaanites</hi> and other Nations who inhabited <hi>Pale≈øtine,</hi> a larger and fairer proportion thereof was alotted for the inheritance of this <hi>Royal Tribe</hi> than any of their Brethren enjoyed; in which Patrimony there were ≈øeveral large fenced Cities, the chief whereof was <hi>Hebron,</hi> and great numbers of plea≈øant and fruitful Villages.</p>
               <p>But altho' <hi>Judah</hi> had received the promi≈øe of the Kingly Dignity, yet he was not till many years after the return out of <hi>Egypt</hi> inve≈øted with it, but the Government was laid on the ≈øhoulders ≈øometimes of one man and ≈øometimes of another, who were either by the ≈øpecial direction of Heaven, or the favour of the People, indifferently cho≈øen out of any Tribe.

               <p>But <hi>Saladine,</hi> who was rather inraged than daunted by this overthrow, re≈øolved not to be long before he recovered his credit, and therefore, about two months after he fell with his <hi>Mammalukes,</hi> like a mighty and raging Tempe≈øt, upon the Chri≈øtians as they were dividing the ≈øpoil of a Party of <hi>Turks,</hi> whom they had van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui≈øhed a little before, putting mo≈øt of them to the Sword, and the re≈øt to flight

               <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Dama≈øcus</hi> having now recovered its ≈øelf from the Famine, and <hi>Saladine</hi> obtained his ends by the Truce, would ob≈øerve it no longer; wherefore having gotten together a good Army, he marcht out of <hi>Egypt</hi> through <hi>Pale≈øtine,</hi> de≈øtroying and ≈øpoiling the Country all along as he went to <hi>Dama≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus.</hi> And having ≈øtrengthened him≈øelf with the addition of what Forces he had in <hi>Syria,</hi> he entred the Holy Land again. But the King, who had not above ≈øeven hundred Men to twenty thou≈øand, met him at a ≈ømall Village called <hi>Frobolt,</hi> and oppo≈øing Valour to his multitudes, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw him in a great and bloody Battel, wherein <hi>Saladine</hi> him≈øelf was forced by ≈øpeedy flight to e≈øcape the danger, and by long Marches get him again to <hi>Dama≈øcus.</hi> Nor had he any better ≈øucce≈øs, when ≈øhortly after he be≈øieged <hi>Berytus,</hi> being forced by the valour and courage of <hi>Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> to rai≈øe his Siege, and depart with di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace.</p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:37155:52"/>
               <p>Wherefore <hi>Saladine</hi> finding ≈øuch tough re≈øi≈øtance in the Holy Land, hoped to gain a better purcha≈øe by imploying his Arms in <hi>Me≈øopotamia,</hi> to which end pa≈ø≈øing the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> he won <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> and divers other Towns, after which, returning again into <hi>Syria,</hi> he be≈øieged <hi>Aleppo,</hi> which was the ≈øtronge≈øt place the Chri≈øtians had in the whole Country, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øo fortified both by Nature and Art, that it would have been almo≈øt impo≈ø≈øible for him to have taken it, had he not by his Bribes made a far larger Breach in the Governours Loyalty, than he was able to do in the Walls of the City.</p>
               <p>But having by this means po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed him≈øelf of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> he marched again into the Holy Land, being now more formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable than ever he had been before; and carrying an Army of Terrour in the very mention of his name, ≈øo that the poor Chri≈øtians unanimou≈øly fled into their fenced Cities. As for King <hi>Baldwin,</hi> the Lepro≈øie had arre≈øted and confined him within the compa≈øs of his own Court, where his great ≈øpirit long ≈øtrove with his infirmity, being loth to part with his Crown, and di≈ørobe him≈øelf of his Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, before they were pluckt away by death; but was however forced at la≈øt to ≈øtoop and retire him≈øelf to a private
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:37155:53"/>life, appointing <hi>Baldwin</hi> his Nephew (a Child of five years old) to be his Succe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øor, and <hi>Guy</hi> Earl of <hi>Joppa,</hi> and <hi>Askelon,</hi> who was the young Childs Father in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law, to be Protector of the Realm in his minority. But ≈øoon after finding <hi>Guy</hi> to be a ≈øilly, ≈øoft man, he revoked the latter Act, and de≈øigned <hi>Raimund</hi> Earl of <hi>Tripoli</hi> to ≈øucceed him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guy,</hi> who though he was not valiant, yet was very ≈øullen, ≈øtormed extreamly at his di≈øgrace, and leaving the Court in di≈øcontent, returned home, and fortified his Cities of <hi>Joppa</hi> and <hi>Askelon,</hi> which greatly perplexed the Kings thoughts, not knowing whom to name for Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, fearing le≈øt <hi>Guys</hi> cowardline≈øs ≈øhould lo≈øe the Kingdom to the <hi>Turks,</hi> or <hi>Raimunds</hi> treachery get it for him≈øelf, ≈øo that angui≈øh of mind, and weakne≈øs of body ended his days, when he was about five and twenty years of age, happy in dying before the death of his Kingdom.</p>

               <p>Now the Earl of <hi>Tripoli</hi> demanding to be Protector of this young King, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

This Prince unhappy in ≈øpringing from ≈øo inhuman and barbarous a Mother, Reigned but eight Months and eight Days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baldwin</hi> being thus di≈øpatched, <hi>Guy</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by large Bribes to the Templars, and <hi>Heraclius</hi> the Patriarch, to be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately crowned, from which time the Chri≈øtians affairs in the Kingdom of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øalem,</hi> po≈øted towards their fatal period, being ≈øpurr'd on the fa≈øter by the woful jarrings and di≈øcords among the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. But we ≈øhall at pre≈øent leave the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, to di≈øcour≈øe a little of the Eccle≈øia≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal affairs of this declining Realm.</p>
               <p>Whil≈øt <hi>Heraclius</hi> was Patriarch of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru≈øalem,</hi> one <hi>Hymericus</hi> injoyed that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour at <hi>Antioch,</hi> who wrote a bemoaning Letter to <hi>Henry</hi> the Second of <hi>England,</hi> wherein he much lamented the woful ≈øtate of the Chri≈øtians in the Ea≈øt, and endeavoured to per≈øuade that Prince to undertake a Voyage into <hi>Pale≈øtine</hi> for their
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:37155:54"/>≈øuccour and relief; and received from him in an≈øwer thereunto a Letter fraught with fair and ample promi≈øes, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance whereof I could never yet meet with in any of tho≈øe Hi≈øtorians, who wrote the Tran≈øactions of the Holy War.</p>
               <p>But be≈øides tho≈øe Latine Patriarchs which commanded in the Churches of <hi>Jeru≈øalem</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> there were <hi>Grecian</hi> Anti-Patriarchs, who were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Emperour of <hi>Con≈øtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> and having no temporal Power nor Juri≈ødiction over the Latines, nor Profits of Church-Lands, were forced to content them≈øelves with a Juri≈ødiction over tho≈øe of the Greek Church only. We are not able to find out the exact Chain of their Succe≈ø≈øion, and therefore are forced to content our ≈øelves with di≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering here and there a Link. And about this time we light on three that enjoyed that titular Dignity ≈øucce≈ø≈øively one after another; the fir≈øt whereof was <hi>Athana≈øius,</hi> who was (notwith≈øtanding his being called Schi≈ømatick by ≈øome of the Hi≈øtorians of that Age) a very learned and pious Man, as appears by the many excellent Epi≈øtles which he wrote upon ≈øeveral oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øions. The ≈øecond was <hi>Leontius,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended likewi≈øe to Po≈øterity for an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øt Man, and a good Scholar. The third
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:37155:55"/>was <hi>Do≈øitheus,</hi> who was much inferiour to the two former both for Piety and Learning, and being offered the Patriarch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip of <hi>Con≈øtantinople,</hi> by <hi>I≈øaac</hi> the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Emperour, he attempted to gra≈øp at both, and by that means held neither, but between two Patriarchal Chairs fell ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverably to the ground.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Antioch</hi> likewi≈øe we find ≈øeveral Greek Patriarchs, whereof one, who≈øe name was <hi>Sotericus,</hi> being di≈øplaced for ≈øeveral Heretical Tenets which he held concerning our Saviour, he was ≈øucceeded by <hi>Theodorus Bal≈øamon,</hi> who was in his time the very Oracle of the Civil Law, compiling and publi≈øhing many Learned Commentaries upon the Ancient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, wherein he proved the Patriarch of <hi>Con≈øtantinople</hi> to have greater privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges than the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> catching, ≈øay the <hi>Romani≈øts,</hi> at every thing that ≈øounded to the advancing of the Ea≈øtern Churches, and the pulling down <hi>Rome,</hi> when ≈øhe lifts up her Head above <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtantinople,</hi> for which rea≈øon <hi>Bellar min</hi> will not allow him to be a good Author. This <hi>Bal≈øamon</hi> was likewi≈øe deceived by <hi>I≈øaac</hi> the <hi>Grecian</hi> Emperour, who pretended that he would remove him to <hi>Con≈øtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> upon condition he could prove the Tran≈ølation of Patriarchs to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:37155:55"/>in regard the Canons forbid it; but having performed the task, the Emperour, who was very mutable in his mind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtowed the Patriarchs place upon another, and left <hi>Bal≈øamon</hi> to remain ≈øtill at <hi>Antioch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There being about this time a Truce between the Turks and Chri≈øtians, and <hi>Saladine</hi>'s Mother, ≈øuppo≈øing her ≈øelf ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently guarded thereby, adventuring to travel from <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Dama≈øcus,</hi> with abundance of Trea≈øure, and a very ≈ømall Train, ≈øhe was, notwith≈øtanding the Truce, ≈øurprized, and riffled of all ≈øhe had by <hi>Reinold</hi> of <hi>Ca≈øtile,</hi> which ba≈øe and unchri≈øtian act ≈øo inraged <hi>Saladine,</hi> that gathering together all his ≈øtrength, he immediately be≈øieged <hi>Ptolemais.</hi> And the Earl of <hi>Tripoli</hi> vext at his lo≈øing the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, was ≈øo blinded by pa≈ø≈øion, and filled with rage again≈øt King <hi>Guy,</hi> that he mi≈øtook his Enemy, and revenged him≈øelf on God and Religion, by ba≈øely revolting with his whole Principality (which was a third part of the Kingdom of <hi>Jeru≈øalem</hi>) to <hi>Saladine,</hi> and a≈ø≈øi≈øting him in that Siege.</p>

He was Son to <hi>Boniface</hi> Marque≈øs of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> who was taken Pri≈øoner in that Fatal Battle wherein King <hi>Guy</hi> lo≈øt him≈øelf and his Kingdom. His Youth was for the mo≈øt part ≈øpent in the Service of <hi>I≈øaaccius An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelus</hi> the <hi>Grecian</hi> Emperour; who being bred in a Mona≈øtery, the confining of his Body ≈øeemed to have brought him to a pent and narrow Soul, and indued him with Accompli≈øhments more becoming a Prie≈øt than a Prince: For when his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Subjects affronted him to the face, in≈øtead of ≈øending an Army again≈øt them, to reduce them to their obedience he only committed his cau≈øe to a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:37155:59"/>of Bald-pated Friers, whom he kept in his Court, to pray for his Pro≈øperity; Hoping that, by their ≈øuppo≈øed Pious Tears, he ≈øhould be able to quench the Combu≈øtions of his Empire. But this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade</hi> told him plainly, that if ever he intended to ≈øit upon the Imperial Throne in Peace, he mu≈øt make u≈øe of the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of the left Hand, as well as tho≈øe of the right, and Fight as well as Pray. Which advice being taken by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, he did, by the help of this General, quickly ≈øubdue all his Enemies: But our brave <hi>Conrade</hi> found but a ≈ømall reward for ≈øo great a ≈øervice, being only graced, in con≈øideration thereof, to wear his Shoes of the Imperial Fa≈øhion; And it being u≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al with Princes, not to love the ≈øight of tho≈øe to whom they know them≈øelves obliged, and yet care not to reward, <hi>I≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accius,</hi> by the per≈øwa≈øion of ≈øome about him, who envied his Courage and Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, ≈øpurred on <hi>Conrade,</hi> who was free e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of him≈øelf to any Noble Enterprize, to go into <hi>Pale≈øtine,</hi> and endeavour to ≈øupport the ruinous affairs of the afflicted Chri≈øtians. And although he was ≈øen≈øible of their Plot yet, being weary of the <hi>Grecians</hi> ba≈øene≈øs, he ≈øuffered him≈øelf to be prevailed upon to undertake that Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Imployment, and therefore ≈øet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:37155:59"/>with all convenient ≈øpeed, for the Holy Land, with a gallant Band of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, who fitted out them≈øelves at their own charge, wherewith he march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the City of <hi>Tyre,</hi> where we will leave him for the pre≈øent, to return again to <hi>Saladine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Who having won the City, and po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øed him≈øelf of the greate≈øt part of the Kingdom of <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> laid clo≈øe Siege to the City of <hi>Askelon,</hi> which had refu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ≈øurrender, when <hi>Ptolemais</hi> and the re≈øt yielded to his victorious Arms; but was now, after a ≈øhort Siege, delivered to him, upon condition that King <hi>Guy</hi> &amp; <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard,</hi> Ma≈øters of the Templars, ≈øhould be ≈øett at Liberty And ≈øhortly after the Ca≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Antioch</hi> was betrayed to him by the Patriarch: And <hi>Antioch</hi> it ≈øelf, which co≈øt the Chri≈øtians 11 Months Siege was by that means lo≈øt in an in≈øtant, be≈øides ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Provinces thereunto belonging, &amp; Five &amp; Twenty ≈øtrong Towns more, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the like Fate with <hi>Antioch,</hi> and fell into the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the <hi>Turks.</hi> After which he ≈øat down likewi≈øe before <hi>Tripo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li,</hi> but that City being, after the death of Earl <hi>Reimond,</hi> delivered to the Chri≈øtians by his Wife, they Bravely defended it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt all <hi>Saladines</hi> Force, ≈øo that having once ta≈øted of their Valour in <hi>Tripoli</hi> he
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:37155:60"/>had no great Stomach to make a ≈øecond trial, but rai≈øed his Siege, and marched away to <hi>Tyre,</hi> where he hoped to ≈øpeed better. But he found him≈øelf greatly mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, for <hi>Conrade</hi> being a little before got thither with his Army, gave him ≈øo hot a Welcome that he was glad to fly, and leave all his Tents behind him, which were ≈øufficiently lined with Trea≈øure, whereby the Chri≈øtians had the happine≈øs to inrich them≈øelves with their own Spoil.</p>
               <p>Tho≈øe in the City over-joyed at their great deliverance, cho≈øe <hi>Conrade</hi> to be King of <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> ≈øwearing Fealty to him, and promi≈øing to be for ever his Subjects, who≈øe Valour had pre≈øerved them from being <hi>Saladines</hi> Slaves. And the better to ≈øtrengthen his Title he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>Eli≈øa,</hi> or, as others call her, <hi>I≈øabella,</hi> Si≈øter to <hi>Baldwin</hi> the fourth, and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to King <hi>Almerick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that King <hi>Guy,</hi> who was about this time delivered out of Pri≈øon having, when he was relea≈øed, ≈øworn never more to bear Arms again≈øt <hi>Saladine</hi> (which Oath the Clergy judged void, becau≈øe forced from him when detained in Pri≈øon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to promi≈øe) obtained his Liberty, but could not get his Kingdom: For com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Tyre,</hi> he found the Gates ≈øhut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt him, and his Subjects refu≈øing to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:37155:60"/>acknowledge any other King then <hi>Conrade.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Guy,</hi> packing up a Cloth of Remnants, with his broken Army, went and be≈øieged <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> the <hi>Pi≈øans, Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> and <hi>Florentines,</hi> with their Sea-For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, a≈ø≈øi≈øting him therein; But it went on notwith≈øtanding ≈øo ≈ølowly, that it could hardly be perceived to have made any advance in a Twelve Months time.</p>
               <p>Things going thus wofully to wrack in <hi>Pale≈øtine,</hi> the Chri≈øtians ≈øighs there alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Brethren in <hi>Europe,</hi> to repair thither to their Succour, and among the re≈øt <hi>Frederick Barbaro≈ø≈øa,</hi> Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> moved by the ≈øtrength of his Devotion, undertook a Voyage thither, when he was Seventy Years old, having one foot in the Grave, and yet adventure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with the other, to go on Pilgrimage. He had been long chained to the Stake, as it were, and baited by ≈øeveral ≈øucce≈ø≈øive Popes, till at length wearied with their continual worrying of him, he gave up him≈øelf wholly to their direction, and was ≈øent by Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the third, on this Errand into the Holy Land.</p>
               <p>And having made great Preparations for this Adventure, he marched through <hi>Hungary,</hi> with a gallant Army of an Hundred and Fifty Thou≈øand Valiant Men, being kindly received and Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:37155:61"/>by King <hi>Bela.</hi> But changing his Ho≈øt, he changed his Entertainment to being ba≈øely u≈øed as he pa≈ø≈øed through the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire: In≈øomuch that <hi>Frederick,</hi> contrary to his expectation, finding ≈øuch perfidious dealing from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> drew his Sword, and re≈øolving to fight his way through, took <hi>Philippople, Adrianople,</hi> and divers other Citys, not ≈øo much to get their Spoil, as to ≈øecure his pa≈ø≈øage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Pale≈øtine.</hi> But when <hi>I≈øaaccius</hi> ≈øaw that tho≈øe Pilgrims would either find or force their pa≈ø≈øage, he left off all terms of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and pre≈øently accommodated them with all things nece≈ø≈øary for their Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øportation over the <hi>Bo≈øphorus,</hi> pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ha≈øten them away, becau≈øe the Chri≈øtians Exigencies in <hi>Pale≈øtine</hi> admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of no delay; although it was really the effect of his fear, the <hi>Greeks</hi> ever lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Latin,</hi> be≈øt when they were fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the≈øt off.</p>
               <p>Old <hi>Frederick,</hi> having now left the treacherous <hi>Grecian</hi> Shore, and entred into the <hi>Turki≈øh</hi> Territories, found great re≈øi≈øtance from the <hi>Sultan</hi> of <hi>Iconium,</hi> whom he vanqui≈øhed, and overcame in four ≈øeveral Battles; And then, be≈øieging the City of <hi>Iconium,</hi> he took it by force and gave the Spoil of it to his Souldiers, to revenge the injury done by that <hi>Sultan</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:37155:61"/>to his Uncle <hi>Conrade</hi> the Emperour: And removing from thence to <hi>Philomela,</hi> he took that likewi≈øe, razing it to the ground, and executing the Inhabitants therein, as Rebels again≈øt the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for killing his Amba≈ø≈øadors; after which he pa≈ø≈øed with much difficulty, but more honour, into <hi>Syria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saladine</hi> ≈øhook for fear at the rumor of his coming, and thought it be≈øt to follow the advice of <hi>Charatux,</hi> his chief Coun≈øel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, who was at that time accounted one of the wi≈øe≈øt men in the world, tho his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon was mean and contemptible, and di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantled all his Citys, in the Holy Land, except his Frontire Towns that ≈øo they might not be tenable with an Army, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing le≈øt, if the <hi>Germans</hi> won tho≈øe places, it would be no ea≈øy matter to drive them out again, but being naked from ≈øhelter, he thought he ≈øhould ≈øoon weary them with ≈øet Battles, in regard he had Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers without number, and tho≈øe near at hand.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Frederick,</hi> ≈øoon after he was entered into the Holy Land, was ≈øuddenly taken away being, to the great grief of all Chri≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, unhappily drowned in the River of <hi>Saleph;</hi> the occa≈øion whereof is vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øly reported by Hi≈øtorians, but they all agree that there he lo≈øt his Life, and

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:37155:62"/>them to retire. Then <hi>Frederick</hi> ≈øummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the City of <hi>Antioch,</hi> had it pre≈øently delivered to him, where his hungry Souldiers being well refre≈øhed by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens who were yet for the mo≈øt part Chri≈øtians, he marched forth in Battle Array, and meeting with <hi>Dodequin,</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of <hi>Saladines</hi> forces, he gave him a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty overthrow, wherein he ≈ølew four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand upon the place, and took a thou≈øand <hi>Turks</hi> Pri≈øoners, with little or no lo≈øs to him≈øelf. After which he went to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Tyre,</hi> in the Cathedral Church whereof he buried the Corps of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and warlike Father, near the Tomb of the Learned <hi>Origen:</hi> His Funeral Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon being preached by the worthy Arch-bi≈øhop <hi>Gulielmus</hi> of <hi>Tyre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So ≈øoon as the Emperors Funeral Rites were ≈øolemnly performed, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed by Sea to the Chri≈øtian Army before <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> where young <hi>Frederick</hi> died of the Plague, and all his huge Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which at their ≈øetting out of <hi>Germany</hi> con≈øi≈øted of an hundred and fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand men, were now reduced to eighteen hundred onely</p>
               <p>And thus, by following this numerous Army to their graves, we have once again overtaken the tedious and ≈ølow-paced ≈øiege of <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> before which place
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:37155:63"/>lay an Army that was, as it were, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment of the Chri≈øtian World, there being ≈øcarce a petty ≈øtate or populous City in <hi>Europe,</hi> that had not ≈øome repre≈øentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives there. So that there were many bloody Blowes lent on both ≈øides, &amp; repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again with intere≈øt in innumerable Sallys, fierce A≈ø≈øaults, and bloody En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters. The Chri≈øtians lying between <hi>Saladine</hi> and the City were be≈øieged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, whil≈øt they be≈øieged <hi>Ptolemais.</hi> It was at la≈øt propo≈øed by <hi>Saladine,</hi> that both ≈øides ≈øhould try their fortune in the field, which was ea≈øily a≈ø≈øented to by the Chri≈øtians, in hopes that they ≈øhould thereby both obtain the victory and win the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which they concluded would not hold out long, if <hi>Saladine</hi> were beaten. But when they were going to ingage, an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary fear ≈øuddenly ≈øeizing them, they all turned their backs and fled; So waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are the Scales of Victory, that ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the lea≈øt mote will turn them. In which confu≈øion many would have thought them≈øelves happy if they could have exchanged a ≈øtrong Hand, for a ≈øwift Foot. But <hi>Geoffrey Lu≈øignan,</hi> Brother to King <hi>Guy,</hi> who was left to guard the Camp, ≈øeeing the Chri≈øtians ≈øhamefully to run away, marched out with his men to meet them, and having convinced them of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:37155:63"/>the cau≈øele≈øsne≈øs of their fear, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with them to return again, they ≈øet upon the <hi>Turks</hi> with ≈øo much fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and rage, that they quickly won the day, though it co≈øt them the lo≈øs of two thou≈øand men, and <hi>Gerard</hi> Ma≈øter of the Templars.</p>
               <p>After this victory it was vainly expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Chri≈øtians, that the City would pre≈øently be ≈øurrendred to them, but the <hi>Turks</hi> ≈øtill continued to defend it with much re≈øolution, though mo≈øt of their hou≈øes were already burnt, or beaten down, and the whole City reduced to a perfect Sceleton of Walls and Towers.

               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:37155:72"/>
               <p>And thus this great undertaking of tho≈øe two mighty and Warlike Kings, began with great Confidence, managed with much Courage, and attended with good Succe≈øs, ended, notwith≈øtanding with ≈øome Honour indeed to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, but no manner of Profit, either to them≈øelves, or the <hi>Chri≈øtian</hi> cau≈øe.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Richard</hi> in this Voyage eternized his Memory, and to the Glory of the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Nation, render'd his Name ≈øo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to the <hi>Turks,</hi> that they were u≈øed to ≈øay to their Hor≈øes when they ≈øtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for fear, what do≈øt thou think King <hi>Richard</hi> is here?

               <p>And <hi>Alphir</hi> who was his next Succe≈ø≈øor, under≈øtanding that the <hi>Chri≈øtian</hi> Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> were at variance among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, re≈øolved to lay hold of that oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity as the fite≈øt time finally to expel the <hi>Christians</hi> out of <hi>Palestine,</hi> and therefore coming out of <hi>Egypt</hi> with a great Army, he be≈øieged and won the Cities of <hi>Tripo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li, Sidon,</hi> and <hi>Berytus,</hi> and being incourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this Succe≈øs, he adventured to Be≈øiege <hi>Tyre</hi> it ≈øelf and notwith≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its invincible ≈øtrength, took it in a very ≈øhort time, and beat it down to the ground as he did the other three Cities.</p>
               <p>So that now there remained nothing of all that the <hi>Christians</hi> had won in <hi>Pale≈øtine,</hi> but <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> which he might ea≈øily have taken, if he would have ≈øate down before with his Army, but he was unwilling to venture for fear, lea≈øt if he ≈øhould attempt the taking all from them at once, he might thereby alarum the <hi>Christian</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to repair thither for their Relief; and therefore concluded a Peace with the <hi>Venetians</hi> for five years, thinking that the bitter potion would be the more ea≈øily
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:37155:106"/>≈øwallowed by them, if it were devided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two do≈øes.</p>
               <p>But tho' the City <hi>Ptolemais</hi> did at this time e≈øcape the <hi>Turks</hi> Victorious Arms' yet it was notwith≈øtanding in a mo≈øt Wofull and Di≈ømal condition, for there were in it ≈øome of all Countrys, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Nation had their ≈øeveral Courts, to de≈øide cau≈øes in; ≈øo that the great plenty of Judges occa≈øiond a ≈øcarcity of Ju≈øtice, and Malefactors when they were impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for any Crime, would by appealing to a Tryal in the Court of their own Country: e≈øcape the de≈øerved Puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it being a ≈øufficient proof of the Criminals innocency in the <hi>Venetians,</hi> or <hi>Genoans</hi> Court, to ≈øay, that he was a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the <hi>State,</hi> to which the Court be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed; wherefore Per≈øonal Crimes were made National, and particular faults by being e≈øpou≈øed, rendered publick offences, ≈øo that outrages were every where practi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and no where puni≈øhed, as if they had been re≈øolved to ≈øpare Divine Vengance the pains of overtaking them, by going forth to meet it.</p>
               <p>Be≈øides which there was at this time a great number of Pretenders, eagerly pro, ≈øecuting their ≈øeveral Titles to that City being no fewer then the <hi>Venetians, Geno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Pi≈øans, Florentins,</hi> the King of <hi>Cyprus</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:37155:107"/>and <hi>Sicily,</hi> the Agents of the King of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> the Princes of <hi>Tripoli</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> the Ma≈øter of the <hi>Templars</hi> and <hi>Ho≈øpitallers,</hi> and the Popes Legate, who would if he were now living think him≈øelf highly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bu≈øed, in not being fir≈øt named. All which Pretenders did at once with much Heat and Violence, urge there Right to the Airy Title of the Kingdom of <hi>Jeru≈øalem;</hi> and the Command of that City, like Bees making the greate≈øt noi≈øe and Bwzzing, when they were ju≈øt ready to for≈øake the Hive.</p>
               <p>There was within the City at this time many new Pilgrims, who were lately come thither out of <hi>Europe,</hi> five hundred where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were of the Popes ≈øending, altho' he afterwards took no care for their Pay, for tho' he loved to ≈øee the Golden Tide flow into his Coffers, yet he could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to ≈øee it ebb again. But the ≈øoldiers being not paid re≈øolved according to their blunt but u≈øual cu≈øtom to pay them≈øelves, and therefore Marching out of the City Pillaged the Enemies Country, contrary to the Peace made with <hi>Alphir.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> demand ≈øatisfaction, which was not only denied by tho≈øe of <hi>Ptolomais,</hi> but their Emba≈ø≈øadors likewi≈øe abu≈øed.</p>
               <p>Which ≈øo inraged Sultan <hi>Serapha</hi> (<hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phir</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:37155:107"/>being now dead) that he gathered together all his Forces, and ≈øat down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the City, with an Army of ≈øix hundred thou≈øand men ≈øay ≈øome Hi≈øtorians, tho' others make them not half the number, and concluding that that City was ≈øo great a purcha≈øe, that if once obtained it could not be too dearly bought, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolved to take it before he ≈øtirred from the place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter Belvi≈øe</hi> Ma≈øter of the <hi>Templars,</hi> a Valiant and Couragious General, being made Governour of the City by the gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al con≈øent of tho≈øe within, he incouraged the <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> to be Valiant, and play the Men and not like Prodigal Heirs part with the City for nothing, which co≈øt their Predece≈ø≈øors ≈øo much pains, and Blood to get, or at lea≈øtwi≈øe to make one Blaze of Valour before their Lamp ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, telling them, it would be a ≈øhame for them to ≈øhew their Friends their Faces, if they turned their Backs to their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and thefore exhorted them to fight it out manfully, that ≈øo if forced at la≈øt to ≈øurrender it they might rather be pittied for want of Fortune, then ju≈øtly blamed for lack of Valour. And the City being now to wre≈øtle its la≈øt fall, he ≈øtripped it of all things that were comber≈øom and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>u≈øeful, for all the Women and Children
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:37155:108"/>and the Men too that were either aged or feeble, and had Mouths to eat and no Arms to fight he ≈øent away, retaining on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly twelve thou≈øand, which he conceived enough to defend the place notwith≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the va≈øt number of the be≈øiegers.</p>
               <p>The Sultan A≈ø≈øaulted the City divers times with great Fury, but was ≈øtill beaten back by the <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> Artillery, and great numbers of the <hi>Turks</hi> killed, but in one of tho≈øe conflicts the undaunted Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our was unfortunately ≈ølain by a poy≈øoned Arrow; a lo≈øs above grieving for, and the greater becau≈øe irreparable, many indeed were ≈øtrong in de≈øiring the Honour, but all too weak to di≈øcharge the Office; ≈øo that the <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> being devided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them≈øeves neglected to defend the City, imagining that if it ≈øhould be taken, yet every Nation would be able to defend its part in regard their buildings were all fortified within them≈øelves, which idle and dangerous fancy took off their thoughts from minding the publick good, and fixed them only on their own private ends.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> at length taking the advant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of this Prepo≈øterous neglect, entred the City at a breach which they had made in the Wall, by undermining of it, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their work had then been done, tho'
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:37155:108"/>they quickly found to their co≈øt that it was but ju≈øt begun, for to their a≈øtoni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and wonder, they found <hi>Ptolemais</hi> not a City but a great heap of Citys, as it were thrown together, the people of every Nation having ≈øo Fortified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves in their ≈øeveral Forts, that they didfrom thence Power forth whole vollies of ≈øhot upon the <hi>Turks,</hi> when they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Streets, which makes it a thing hardly to be paralell'd in Hi≈øtory, for a City to hold out ≈øo long after it was taken, for they bravely defended them≈øelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the Whole <hi>Turki≈øh</hi> power for fifty days together, and after all the re≈øt were ≈øubdued the Knights <hi>Ho≈øpitallers</hi> who all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways bore an implacable hatred to the <hi>Turks,</hi> maintained their Ca≈øtle near a month long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but their unhappy devi≈øion render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them unable to ≈øub≈øi≈øt long, they were at length mo≈øt of them ≈ølain, and the City wholy ≈øubdued by there numerous enemies.</p>
               <p>However it was a Bloody Victory to the Conquerour, mo≈øt of tho≈øe who enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the City being burned with Fire, kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Arrows, or Smothered by the fall of Towers, of the very Ruins being as it were greedy of revenge, killed tho≈øe who de≈øtroyed them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ptolemais</hi> being now taken the Sultan thought it a good penyworth, tho' it co≈øt
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:37155:109"/>him ≈øo dear, and therefore to make ≈øure work and prevent all feuture occa≈øion of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting ≈øuch ≈øturdy Tennants, Levelled it even with the Ground.</p>
               <p>No fewer then an hundred thou≈øand <hi>Christians</hi> which were all the <hi>Latines</hi> that were left; fled at this time out of <hi>Pale≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> into <hi>Cyprus,</hi> where they were freely entertained by <hi>Henry</hi> King of that I≈øland and <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> to his great co≈øt but greater commendation.</p>
               <p>Five hundred Matrons and Virgins of Noble Blood, are by the Mirracle Mong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of that age, ≈øaid to ≈øtand on the ≈øhore of <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> with all their rich Jewels &amp; cry out with a lamentable voice for ≈øome body to Tran≈øport them from that dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous place, proffering any Marriner that would undertake it all their Wealth for his pains, and that he ≈øhould cho≈øe out of them any one whom he be≈øt liked for a Wife, and that thereupon a certain Marriner came and Tran≈øported them all freely, Landing them ≈øafely in <hi>Cyprus.</hi> But when he was ≈øent for to receive his Hire, it could not by the ≈øtricte≈øt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry be ever learnt who this Marriner was, or what became of him afterwards.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ho≈øpitallers</hi> were forced for ha≈øt to leave their Trea≈øure behind them which they hid in a Vault, making it known
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:37155:109"/>from time to time to their Succe≈ø≈øors. About three hundred years after it was fetch'd away by the Galleys of <hi>Malta.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus after an hundred thirty four years had this <hi>Holy War</hi> its final period, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been for continuance the longe≈øt, for Charges the mo≈øt expen≈øive, for Slaught<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Men the mo≈øt Bloody, for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence the mo≈øt Pious, and for the True In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of it the mo≈øt Politick and Subtil that ever the World ≈øaw.

                     <hi>The</hi> Holy War <hi>revived again by the pre≈øent Emperor of</hi> Germany, <hi>and the King of</hi> Poland. <hi>With the Parallel between that and the former War.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>SInce the <hi>Holy War</hi> was ended there hath been ≈øome offers of <hi>Chri≈øtian</hi> Princes to revive it again. For <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth King of <hi>England,</hi> towards the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of his Reign, purpo≈øed to have made a Voyage into <hi>Pale≈øtine,</hi> being told by ≈øome pretenders to the gift of Prophe≈øie, that he ≈øhould not die tell he had heard Ma≈øs in <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> but <hi>Henry</hi> was deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Voyage prevented by his dying ≈øoon after in a Chamber in his own Palace, at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter</hi> called by that name. And <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth King of <hi>France</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his return out of <hi>Italy,</hi> ≈øent a huffing Emba≈ø≈øage to our <hi>Henry</hi> the ≈øeventh, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he gave him to under≈øtand that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolved to make a ≈øecond conque≈øt of <hi>Naples,</hi> with a de≈øign to make u≈øe of it as a bridge, to tran≈øport his Forces into <hi>Grecia,</hi> re≈øolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither to ≈øpare blood nor trea≈øure, altho' it were to the imparing of his Crown, and di≈øpeopling of his Kingdom, till he had either ruined the <hi>Ottaman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:37155:110"/>or taken it in his way to Par adice, (meaning the City of <hi>Jeru≈øalem</hi>) but the <hi>French</hi> having had enough of the fir≈øt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture for <hi>Naples,</hi> we never hear more of this threatned Voyage, to <hi>Jeru≈øalem</hi> which is thought to be propounded, only to amu≈øe <hi>Henry</hi> till <hi>Charles</hi> ≈øhould have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed ≈øome projects he had then on foot, in the Dukedom of <hi>Britain,</hi> which de≈øign being ≈øcented by our King he u≈øed him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
               <p>More Cordial was the de≈øign of <hi>James</hi> the Fourth of <hi>Scotland,</hi> Who being touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in con≈øcience for his Fathers death (which tho' he did not procure, yet he ≈øeemed to countenance by his pre≈øence) to expiate his Crime, intended a voyage to the <hi>Holy Land.</hi> In order whereunto he had prepared his Souldiers, and imparted his de≈øign to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein Princes, and had certainly gon had not other wars breaking out unexpectedly, and his own ≈øudden death prevented him.</p>
               <p>Among tho≈øe Overtures, we find one ≈øaid to be really performed by <hi>William Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi> of <hi>He≈ø≈øe,</hi> who with only Ninety eight Noble-men and Earls in his Company, made a Holy Voyage into <hi>Palestine,</hi> which he performed in Seven Months time. And upon his return, brought away with him Forty ≈øix En≈øigns of Hor≈øe, which he had taken from the <hi>Turks,</hi> with the lo≈øs of one
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:37155:111"/>Man only, and he not ≈ølain neither, but died at <hi>Cyprus</hi> in their return home. A Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory ≈øo ab≈øolute and bloodle≈øs to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, that were it true it would admit no parallel; but the Voyage and Victory were both fictitious, being found only in <hi>Calvi≈øious,</hi> who quotes one <hi>Fab,</hi> an Hi≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian no where to be met withal, for his Author; and the Chronology wherein it is recorded being Printed after the Author's death, it is mo≈øt probable, that tho≈øe to whom the care of Printing it was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, found this ≈øtory in ≈øome Paper he had put in his Chronicle, and for the improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of it, marked it to be Fabulous; which word in regard he had written it defectively with the three fir≈øt Letters only, they thought to have been ≈øome Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtorian who≈øe Name was <hi>Fab,</hi> and ≈øo in≈øerted it in the Chronicle it ≈øelf.</p>

               <p>And that the <hi>Turk</hi> might be imployed on all ≈øides, the <hi>Venetians</hi> were invited like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe into this League again≈øt them, which they accepted of, and ≈øent out a brave fleet under the Command of their Generall <hi>Moro≈øini,</hi> to attack them at home, to whch Fleet the Pope and the Knights of <hi>Malta</hi> al≈øo joyned ≈øeveral of their Galleys, and ≈øo did the Duke of <hi>Tu≈øcany,</hi> making in all forty ≈øix Galleys, ≈øix Gallie≈ø≈øes, thirty three Men of War, twenty four Petaches, four Fire Ships, ≈øixteen Brigantines armed, and eighty two Galliots, on Board where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they had an Army of twenty five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand Men or upwards.</p>

                  <hi>Sancta Maria</hi> a ≈øtrong Fortre≈øs of great con≈øequence to the <hi>Turks,</hi> was the fir≈øt place that felt the force of their victorious Arms, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quickly compelled to a ≈øurrender, they took their cour≈øe towardsd <hi>Lepanto.</hi> And General <hi>Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeni</hi> concluding it nece≈ø≈øary, for the maintaining the Conque≈øt of <hi>Sancta Maria,</hi> to po≈ø≈øe≈øs him≈øelf of <hi>Preve≈øe,</hi> a place of great importance in regard it is ≈øituated at the very entrance, and Commands the Gulf of <hi>Arta,</hi> re≈øolved to attempt it.</p>
               <p>Wherefore having Commanded five Galleys and ≈øix Gallie≈ø≈øes, to approach towards the Ca≈øtles of <hi>Gomenizze,</hi> not far from <hi>Preve≈øe,</hi> thereby to amu≈øe the <hi>Turks</hi> and oblige them to devide their Troops, by ≈øending reinforcements thither, which ≈øucceeded accordingly.

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:37155:113"/>the Town. He brought his whole Fleet to an Anchor at the entrance of the Gulfe, and the next morning ordred Captain <hi>Menetta</hi> with twenty four Barks, and ≈øeveral Armed Brigantines to enter the Gulph, and land with part of the Forces under the Command of General <hi>Stra≈øoldo.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected them to land where the Galleys had po≈øted them≈øelves, and had therefore imployed their Chief care on that ≈øide, now perceiving their error, immediately ≈øent away five hundred <hi>Spahees</hi> to charge them, but they having put them≈øelves into order of Battail, gave them ≈øo hot a welcome that many af them were ≈ølain, and the re≈øt fled in ≈øuch di≈øor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that they were mo≈øt of them cut off, before they could reach the Town. Then the <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> advancing, and having without oppo≈øition po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øed them≈øelves of a Hill near the Town, the General ≈øent to ≈øummon it, but the Officer who cammanded it in the ab≈øence of the Governour, (who was then abroad at the Head of a party of <hi>Turks,</hi> to ob≈øerve the <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> and fancied they dur≈øt not undertake the Siege of ≈øo ≈øtrong a place,) would not receive the Generals letter, but fired upon the Me≈ø≈øenger that carried it; Whereupon four pieces of Cannon and as many Mortars were landed, and being placed upon a Battery, the next day about three hundred Bombs were ≈øhot into the Town, which burnt ≈øeveral Hou≈øes, and before night all their Cannon were di≈ømounted, except one. The next day they Lodged them≈øelves in the Ditch, &amp; began to undermine the great Tower, whereupon twenty <hi>Turks</hi> made a ≈øalley in the night, &amp; ≈øurpri≈øed ≈øome of the <hi>Chri≈øtians,</hi> which did but whet the <hi>Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> Valour, and make them carry on their works with the greater eagerne≈øs and ≈øpeed, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding the Enemy plyed them very clo≈øe, with their ≈ømall ≈øhot. So that the Mine being ready and a con≈øiderable breach made in the Wall, order was
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:37155:114"/>given for a general a≈øault, but the <hi>Turks</hi> unwilling to run that hazzard, hung out a white flag and ≈øent five of their Principals to treat with the Gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, about ≈øurrendering the place. Who demanded the ≈øame conditions that were granted to the gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of <hi>Sancta Maria,</hi> but the General would con≈øent to no other terms, then only to permit thirty of the mo≈øt con≈øiderable of them to march out with their arms, and baggage, and the re≈øt without arms, taking with them what they could carry, which the <hi>Turks</hi> were forced to ≈øubmit to, and leave the Town to the Conqerours. The <hi>Turks</hi> by the lo≈øs of this place, be≈øides the Town it ≈øelf lo≈øt above 100000 Crowns, which they got yearly by the Fi≈øhery.</p>
               <p>This War may very well be parallel'd to the ≈øor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and as Ju≈øtly de≈øerves the Name of <hi>Holy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, becau≈øe in this War the Quarrel is between <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> as well as in that and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øign of the Wariours, is to Check the ≈øpreading of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Super≈øtition, as well as to put a ≈øtop to the progre≈øs of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Arms.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as the former was undertaken to wre≈øt from the <hi>Turks,</hi> what had been before injoyed by the <hi>Chri≈øtians,</hi> and free the Profe≈ø≈øors of <hi>Chr≈øtianity</hi> from the Yoak of Infidelity, ≈øo was this.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as the former had the ble≈ø≈øing of the Pope, and his <hi>Holine≈øs</hi>'s Contribution of money, and men for the carrying of it on, ≈øo had this &amp; therefore will without doubt be looked upon, by Succeeding ages, as an <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Religious War,</hi> which I hope will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have a Period, till <hi>Mahomets</hi> Tomb be tumbled down, and the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire overthrown.</p>
