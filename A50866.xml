            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>The Deſcription of the City of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and the Land of</hi> Judea: <hi>Why it was called the</hi> Holy Land: <hi>It is conquered by the</hi> Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, <hi>by the</hi> Galdeans, <hi>and by the</hi> Romans.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>JAcob</hi> having juſt before his death, called all his Twelve Sons together, to bleſs them, and to tell them what ſhould happen both to them and to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in ſucceeding Ages, he preferred <hi>Judah</hi> (altho' not the Eldeſt, but the Fourth Son) before the reſt of his Brethren, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him to the Throne, ſaying, Judah, <hi>thou art he whom thy brethren ſhall praiſe; thy hand ſhall be in the neck of thy enemies, and thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers children ſhall bow before thee.</hi> Judah <hi>is a Lions whelp: from the prey my ſon thou art gone up.

                  <hi>come</hi> (meaning Chriſt the Saviour of the World) <hi>to whom the gathering of the people ſhall be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And after the return of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the deſtroying the <hi>Canaanites</hi> and other Nations who inhabited <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> a larger and fairer proportion thereof was alotted for the inheritance of this <hi>Royal Tribe</hi> than any of their Brethren enjoyed; in which Patrimony there were ſeveral large fenced Cities, the chief whereof was <hi>Hebron,</hi> and great numbers of pleaſant and fruitful Villages.</p>
               <p>But altho' <hi>Judah</hi> had received the promiſe of the Kingly Dignity, yet he was not till many years after the return out of <hi>Egypt</hi> inveſted with it, but the Government was laid on the ſhoulders ſometimes of one man and ſometimes of another, who were either by the ſpecial direction of Heaven, or the favour of the People, indifferently choſen out of any Tribe. And when the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> grown weary of the Judges rule, requeſted a King, and God commanded <hi>Samuel</hi> to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a <hi>Monarchical Government</hi> among them, as tho' <hi>Jacob</hi> had been miſtaken in his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures or the Promiſe to <hi>Judah,</hi> had been quite forgotten, that Tribe is neglected, and a King choſen out of the Off-ſpring of <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> the youngeſt Son of <hi>Jacob.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Saal</hi> proving diſobedient and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious againſt the Command of the Great and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:37155:8"/>Supream Monarch of Heaven and Earth, by whom alone King Reign, the Royal Dignity was rent both from him and his Tribe, and according to the Prediction of the <hi>Patriarch,</hi> given to <hi>David,</hi> the youngeſt Son of <hi>Jeſſe</hi> the <hi>Bethlehemite</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> out of whoſe Loyns, according to the fleſh, our Saviour came.</p>
               <p>When he was firſt advanced to the Throne, he only reigned over the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and made choice of <hi>Hebron</hi> as his <hi>Royal Seat.</hi> But being afterwards by the <hi>unanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> of all the Tribes, choſen to be King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he took the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which is the Subject of this <hi>Hiſtory</hi> from the <hi>Jebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites,</hi> and made it the <hi>Royal Seat</hi> of the Kings of <hi>Iſreal,</hi> whereupon it was preferred by the great <hi>Jehovah,</hi> before all the Cities of the Earth, to be the place of his own habitation, dwelling as were in a moſt immediate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which was afterward built by King <hi>Solomon,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding all the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to repair thither to do him <hi>homage</hi> and <hi>adoration:</hi> And ſays of it himſelf, <hi>That he loved the gates of</hi> Sion <hi>more than all the dwelling places of</hi> Jacob.

Their Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was to fight againſt Infidels, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Pilgrims in their coming to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre; they vowed Poverty, Chaſtity and Obedience, to which was added by <hi>Reimundus de Podio,</hi> their ſecond Maſter, that they muſt receive the Sacrament thrice a year, hear Maſs once a day, be no Merchants or Uſurers, fight no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Duels, and always ſtand neuters, and take part with neither ſide, if the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> ſhould fall out.</p>

               <p>About the ſame time alſo were ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Knights of the Sepulchre, who were for their Original and Profeſſion much like the former, and their Order continueth to this day, they being made by the <hi>Padre</hi> Guardian of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> of ſuch as have ſeen the Sepulchre, and ſhould be all Gentlemen, but the <hi>Padre</hi> frequently diſpenſes with the ſeverity of that Law, and admits of thoſe who bring fat enough, though no blood.</p>

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:37155:27"/>to ſuck from, and devour it.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, the King alledged, that the Chriſtian Princes had now purchaſed <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with their Blood, and beſtowed it on him, ſo that the Patriarchs over-grown Title was loſt in that Conqueſt, from which, as upon a new Foundation, all muſt now build their claims who challenge a right to any part in that City: Beſides which, it would be unreaſonable for the King of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> to enjoy nothing in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but live there more like a Sojourner than a Prince in his Royal Palace, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined only to an airy Title, whilſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch ſhould enjoy all the Command.</p>
               <p>To this the Patriarch anſwered, That the Chriſtians new Conqueſt could not cancel his Ancient Right, which he ſaid was enjoyed even under the <hi>Saracens,</hi> eſpecially ſince that Voyage was purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly undertaken for the advancing of the Church, and not the bare reſtoring her to her Liberty only; which Argument he preſſed ſo home, that <hi>Godfrey,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he was unwilling at firſt, yet afterwards not only granted him on <hi>Candlemas</hi> day a fourth part of the City, but on the <hi>Eaſter</hi> following (the King lying then on his Death-bed) gave him all <hi>Jeruſalem, Joppa,</hi> and whatſoever elſe

               <p>When he arrived at <hi>Rome,</hi> he found the Popes Doors ſhut againſt him, but he quickly opened them with a Golden Key, and upon his repentance for having refuſed to acknowledge Obedience to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> he was diſmiſſed, only it was ordered by his Holineſs, that the Biſhop of <hi>Oſtia</hi> ſhould be ſent into <hi>Byria,</hi> to examine matters relating to his other Crimes, and proceed accordingly: Whereat his Adverſaries ſtormed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly, expecting that he ſhould have been immediately depoſed: But having miſt their mark, they reſolved to have a ſecond blow at him; wherefore they prevailed with <hi>Albericus</hi> the Legate to favour their deſign, (which was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to <hi>Rodolphus</hi>) who coming to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> cited the Patriarch to appear, but being called three ſeveral times, came not, which was variouſly commented up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by thoſe who were preſent, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they affected or diſaffected him.

               <p>About this time <hi>Calo Johannes</hi> the <hi>Graecian</hi> Emperour came with a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Horſe and Foot, and demanded of <hi>Reimund</hi> Prince of <hi>Antioch,</hi> to reſign to him that whole Signiory, according to the Compoſition which the Chriſtian

                  <hi>William,</hi> who was laſt poſſeſſed of the Patriarchs Chair in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was no great Clerk, being better at Building of Caſtles than at Edifying the Church: He built one at <hi>Askelon,</hi> one at <hi>Ramula,</hi> a third called <hi>Blankguard,</hi> for the ſecuring of Priſoners: But having enjoyed the Dignity Fifteen years, he was tranſlated to Heaven, and <hi>Fulcher</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Tyre</hi> ſucceeded him, whoſe old Age was much moleſted with the Pride and Rebellion of the Hoſpitallers, who had then obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Pope a plenary Exemption from the Juriſdiction of the Patriarch, which he did the more eaſily grant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hoped thereby to make himſelf abſolute Maſter of all Orders, and link them intirely to himſelf by an immediate dependence, whereby he made every Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a Caſtle of Rebels, and armed them with Priviledges to fight their lawful Dioceſan.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Hoſpitallers were by this means become ſo rude, that they would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all ſhame Ring their Bells when the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:37155:39"/>Patriarch Preached, that ſo his Voice might not be heard, and ſhoot Arrows into the Church, to diſturb him and the People in Divine Service. A bundle whereof was hung up in the Church as a Monument of their monſtrous Impiety. <hi>Fulcher</hi> crawled to <hi>Rome</hi> when an hundred years old, to complain of thoſe outrages, but the Hoſpitallers prevented him, and bribed off the buſineſs beforehand, ſo that the good old man was forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn without redreſs, whereupon they grew more inſolent than ever.</p>
               <p>Nor was <hi>Haymericus,</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Rodolphus</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> much quieter. He inſtituted about the year 1160. the Order of <hi>Carmelites,</hi> who pretended to an imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Prophet <hi>Elias.</hi> Some indeed had formerly lived diſperſed about the Mount of <hi>Carmel,</hi> but he gathered them into one Houſe. But although <hi>Paleſtine</hi> brought them forth, yet <hi>England</hi> proved the moſt officious in nurſing of them up: For being firſt brought into it by <hi>Ralph Freſhburgh</hi> in the year 1240. they were firſt ſeated at <hi>Newenden</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and in a little time ſcattered themſelves all over <hi>England,</hi> and lived in great pomp, till diſperſed by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, when he demoliſhed the Abbeys.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>ALL Empires, like the ſwelling Sea, have bounds ſet to them, whither being once come, they can riſe no higher. And the Kingdom of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> being now arrived at its full growth, began to decline apace, till at laſt all revolved again into the Infidels hands. And the firſt conſiderable ſtep which it made in its declenſion, was the loſs of <hi>Edeſſa,</hi> one of the four Tetrarchies of that Kingdom, and a place wherein the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion had always flouriſhed from the time of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>Which loſs moved <hi>Conrade,</hi> Emperour of the Weſt, and <hi>Lewis</hi> the Seventh ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named the Young King of <hi>France,</hi> by the perſuaſion of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take a Voyage to the Holy Land. The Emperour for this deſign had gotten to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether an Army of 200000 Foot, and 50000 Horſe, and the King near as many
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:37155:40"/>more. For in <hi>France</hi> they ſent a Diſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>Conrade</hi> with his Army, took his way through <hi>Graecia,</hi> where <hi>Emmanuel</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, poſſeſſed with an hereditary fear of the Latines, fortified his Cities, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding that there needed ſtrong Banks where ſuch a ſtream of people were to paſs, uſing them moſt treacherouſly, and giving them a very bad welcom, in hope thereby to get rid of them the ſooner. And to increaſe their miſery as they lay incamped by the River <hi>Melas</hi> (if it be proper to call that a River, which is all Mud in Summer, and all Sea in Winter) it drowned many of them by its ſudden and unexpected overflowing, as if it had learn'd Treachery of the <hi>Graecians,</hi> and conſpired with them to ſpoil the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours generous Deſign.</p>
               <p>And thoſe of them that ſurvived this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy accident, were reſerved for a more lingering miſery, the Emperour endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:37155:40"/>by all imaginable ways to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh their Ruine; as by mixing Lime with their Meal, killing thoſe who ſtrayed from the Army, holding intelligence with the <hi>Turks,</hi> corrupting his Coin, and giving them falſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductors, who deſignedly led them into danger, and made the way leſs doubtful than the Guides.</p>
               <p>And no ſooner had the Emperour got through all thoſe dangers, and eſcaped the Treachery of the Greeks, but he was immediately encountred by the Hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who waited for them on the Banks of the River <hi>Meander,</hi> which being not fordable, and the Chriſtians having neither Boat nor Bridge to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey them over, the undaunted Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, after an Exhortation to his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to follow his brave Example, plunged himſelf into the Water, and quickly reached the other Shoar, where, in deſpite of the Enemy, he Landed with all his Army. Whereat the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted <hi>Turks</hi> did as it were offer their Throats to the Chriſtians Swords, and were ſlain in ſuch numbers, that whole piles of dead Bones remain there for a monument of their Victory, fluſhed with this ſucceſs, he marched forward to <hi>Iconium,</hi> now called <hi>Cogni,</hi> which he

For which reaſon, together with their being corrupted with Turkiſh money (although it proved but Braſs gilt, may all Traitors be ſo paid) they perſuaded the King of <hi>France</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move his Camp to a ſtronger part of the Wall, whereby they rendred the deſign of taking the Town fruitleſs, and forced them to raiſe the Siege, and return home, leaving the City of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and even Honour both behind them. Many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Chriſtians periſhed in that adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whoſe Souls are ſaid by all the Writers of that Age, to be carried up to Heaven upon the Wings of that Holy Cauſe they died for. And the King of <hi>France</hi> in his return home was taken Priſoner by the <hi>Graecian</hi> Fleet, but reſcued again by <hi>Gregory,</hi> who was Admiral to <hi>Roger</hi> King of <hi>Sicilia.</hi>

               <p>The King and Emperour being return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Noradine</hi> the <hi>Turk</hi> prevailed in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine,</hi> which was very much occaſioned by the unhappy difference which aroſe between Queen <hi>Milleſent,</hi> and her Son <hi>Baldwin,</hi> who was egged on by ſome of the Nobles that were offended with the

               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:37155:50"/>
               <p>Thoſe Slaves he trained up in Military Diſcipline after the Turkiſh manner. They had moſt of them been Chriſtians, and were baptized in their Infancy; but being taken from their Parents whilſt young, they were untaught Chriſt, and inſtructed in the Mahometan Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby they became the more implacable Enemies to Chriſtianity, for having been once its friends. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from <hi>Saladine</hi> the name of <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malukes,</hi> and were ſo couragious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in War, that his, and his Succeſſors greatneſs, was not to be ſo much attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their own Conduct, as to thoſe <hi>Mammalukes</hi> Valour, till at laſt percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their own ſtrength, they wreſted the Soveraignty from the Turkiſh Kings, and advanced one of their own number to the Regal Dignity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saladine</hi> having thus furniſhed himſelf with a new ſort of Souldiers, reſolved to try their Valour upon the Chriſtian, and therefore invaded the Holy Land, ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and burning all before him, till he came to <hi>Askelon,</hi> where King <hi>Baldwin</hi> then was, before which he ſate down, and cloſely beſieged it. And Count <hi>Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund,</hi> Protector of the Kingdom, <hi>Philip</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the chief ſtrength of the Kingdom being then abſent in
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:37155:51"/>
                  <hi>Celoſyria,</hi> waſting the Country about <hi>Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa</hi> and <hi>Ceſarea. Baldwin</hi> was forced to keep himſelf cloſe in the City, not daring to venture on ſo ſtrong an Enemy; which fear of <hi>Baldwins</hi> having poſſeſſed <hi>Saladine</hi> with a belief that he needed not ſo great an Army to lie before the City, he ſent out ſeveral Parties to forrage and ſpoil the Country, which the King obſerving, reſolved to take opportunity by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, and ſet on him when he leaſt expected it. To which end he ſallied out with great privacy and ſilence, and with about four hundred Horſe, &amp; a few Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſuddenly aſſaulted his ſecure Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with ſuch invincible Courage and Reſolution, that notwithſtanding their number, being Twenty ſix thouſand Horſe and Foot, they were utterly routed, and the Chriſtians returned with great Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph and Joy to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Saladine,</hi> who was rather inraged than daunted by this overthrow, reſolved not to be long before he recovered his credit, and therefore, about two months after he fell with his <hi>Mammalukes,</hi> like a mighty and raging Tempeſt, upon the Chriſtians as they were dividing the ſpoil of a Party of <hi>Turks,</hi> whom they had van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed a little before, putting moſt of them to the Sword, and the reſt to flight
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:37155:51"/>and taking <hi>Otto</hi> Grand Maſter of the Templars, and <hi>Hugh,</hi> Son-in-law to the Count of <hi>Tripoli</hi> Priſoners, the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hardly eſcaping: So that both ſides having ſufficiently ſmarted, conſented to refreſh themſelves with a ſhort Peace, under the ſhelter whereof, their troubled States breathed quietly for the ſpace of about two years, which Truce was the more willingly embraced by <hi>Saladine,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a Famine then raged in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> where it had ſcarcely rained for five years together.</p>
               <p>But this welcom Calm was ſomewhat troubled with an unexpected Storm raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Domeſtick Diſcords in King <hi>Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wins</hi> Court. For the Kings Mother and Uncle, two perſons of turbulent ſpirits, accuſed the Count of <hi>Tripoli</hi> of Treaſon, as if he had, when he was Governour of the Kingdom, affected the Crown for himſelf; which accuſation ſo ſtung the King in the head, that the Count com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhortly after to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was, as he was on the way thither, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſtay, which he looked upon as a great diſgrace. But ſome of the Nobility fearing the miſchiefs which might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from this unhappy difference, brought them to be reconciled. But, though the matter was ſeemingly made up,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:37155:52"/>yet the King ever after looked upon the Earl with a jealous Eye. And the Earl ſeeing himſelf ſuſpected, proved after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards really treacherous and diſloyal, though he is ſuppoſed by moſt Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to be innocent of what he was then charged withal.</p>
               <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> having now recovered its ſelf from the Famine, and <hi>Saladine</hi> obtained his ends by the Truce, would obſerve it no longer; wherefore having gotten together a good Army, he marcht out of <hi>Egypt</hi> through <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> deſtroying and ſpoiling the Country all along as he went to <hi>Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus.</hi> And having ſtrengthened himſelf with the addition of what Forces he had in <hi>Syria,</hi> he entred the Holy Land again. But the King, who had not above ſeven hundred Men to twenty thouſand, met him at a ſmall Village called <hi>Frobolt,</hi> and oppoſing Valour to his multitudes, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw him in a great and bloody Battel, wherein <hi>Saladine</hi> himſelf was forced by ſpeedy flight to eſcape the danger, and by long Marches get him again to <hi>Damaſcus.</hi> Nor had he any better ſucceſs, when ſhortly after he beſieged <hi>Berytus,</hi> being forced by the valour and courage of <hi>Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> to raiſe his Siege, and depart with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace.</p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:37155:52"/>
               <p>Wherefore <hi>Saladine</hi> finding ſuch tough reſiſtance in the Holy Land, hoped to gain a better purchaſe by imploying his Arms in <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> to which end paſſing the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> he won <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> and divers other Towns, after which, returning again into <hi>Syria,</hi> he beſieged <hi>Aleppo,</hi> which was the ſtrongeſt place the Chriſtians had in the whole Country, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo fortified both by Nature and Art, that it would have been almoſt impoſſible for him to have taken it, had he not by his Bribes made a far larger Breach in the Governours Loyalty, than he was able to do in the Walls of the City.</p>
               <p>But having by this means poſſeſſed himſelf of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> he marched again into the Holy Land, being now more formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable than ever he had been before; and carrying an Army of Terrour in the very mention of his name, ſo that the poor Chriſtians unanimouſly fled into their fenced Cities. As for King <hi>Baldwin,</hi> the Leproſie had arreſted and confined him within the compaſs of his own Court, where his great ſpirit long ſtrove with his infirmity, being loth to part with his Crown, and diſrobe himſelf of his Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, before they were pluckt away by death; but was however forced at laſt to ſtoop and retire himſelf to a private
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:37155:53"/>life, appointing <hi>Baldwin</hi> his Nephew (a Child of five years old) to be his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, and <hi>Guy</hi> Earl of <hi>Joppa,</hi> and <hi>Askelon,</hi> who was the young Childs Father in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law, to be Protector of the Realm in his minority. But ſoon after finding <hi>Guy</hi> to be a ſilly, ſoft man, he revoked the latter Act, and deſigned <hi>Raimund</hi> Earl of <hi>Tripoli</hi> to ſucceed him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guy,</hi> who though he was not valiant, yet was very ſullen, ſtormed extreamly at his diſgrace, and leaving the Court in diſcontent, returned home, and fortified his Cities of <hi>Joppa</hi> and <hi>Askelon,</hi> which greatly perplexed the Kings thoughts, not knowing whom to name for Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, fearing leſt <hi>Guys</hi> cowardlineſs ſhould loſe the Kingdom to the <hi>Turks,</hi> or <hi>Raimunds</hi> treachery get it for himſelf, ſo that anguiſh of mind, and weakneſs of body ended his days, when he was about five and twenty years of age, happy in dying before the death of his Kingdom.</p>

               <p>IT hath ever been accounted one of the greateſt happineſſes that can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal a Family, for the Heirs to be of Age before their Fathers death, in regard Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors have not only been the Ruine of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, but the overthrow of Kingdoms too. And it being one of Gods threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings againſt a wicked and diſobedient People to give Children to be their Princes, and Babes to Rule over them, he ſcourged the Kingdom of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> three ſeveral times with that Rod, within the compaſs of forty years. <hi>Baldwin</hi> the Third, Fourth and Fifth, being all under Age, and the laſt but five years old being the <hi>Poſthumus</hi> Son of <hi>William</hi> Marquets of <hi>Montferat,</hi> by <hi>Sybil</hi> his Wife, Siſter to <hi>Baldwin</hi> the Fourth, and Daughter to King <hi>Almerick,</hi> who was after the death of the Marqueſs married to this <hi>Guy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Earl of <hi>Tripoli</hi> demanding to be Protector of this young King, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:37155:54"/>to the deſignation of his Uncle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death; <hi>Sybil,</hi> who was Mother to this Infant, to defeat <hi>Raimunds</hi> hopes of obtaining the Protectorſhip, firſt mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered all natural affections in her own breaſt, and then murthered her Son, by giving him a doſe of Poiſon, that ſo the Crown in her right might come to <hi>Guy</hi> her Husband. This Prince unhappy in ſpringing from ſo inhuman and barbarous a Mother, Reigned but eight Months and eight Days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baldwin</hi> being thus diſpatched, <hi>Guy</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by large Bribes to the Templars, and <hi>Heraclius</hi> the Patriarch, to be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately crowned, from which time the Chriſtians affairs in the Kingdom of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> poſted towards their fatal period, being ſpurr'd on the faſter by the woful jarrings and diſcords among the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. But we ſhall at preſent leave the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, to diſcourſe a little of the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal affairs of this declining Realm.</p>
               <p>Whilſt <hi>Heraclius</hi> was Patriarch of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> one <hi>Hymericus</hi> injoyed that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour at <hi>Antioch,</hi> who wrote a bemoaning Letter to <hi>Henry</hi> the Second of <hi>England,</hi> wherein he much lamented the woful ſtate of the Chriſtians in the Eaſt, and endeavoured to perſuade that Prince to undertake a Voyage into <hi>Paleſtine</hi> for their
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:37155:54"/>ſuccour and relief; and received from him in anſwer thereunto a Letter fraught with fair and ample promiſes, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance whereof I could never yet meet with in any of thoſe Hiſtorians, who wrote the Tranſactions of the Holy War.</p>
               <p>But beſides thoſe Latine Patriarchs which commanded in the Churches of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> there were <hi>Grecian</hi> Anti-Patriarchs, who were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Emperour of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> and having no temporal Power nor Juriſdiction over the Latines, nor Profits of Church-Lands, were forced to content themſelves with a Juriſdiction over thoſe of the Greek Church only. We are not able to find out the exact Chain of their Succeſſion, and therefore are forced to content our ſelves with diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering here and there a Link. And about this time we light on three that enjoyed that titular Dignity ſucceſſively one after another; the firſt whereof was <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> who was (notwithſtanding his being called Schiſmatick by ſome of the Hiſtorians of that Age) a very learned and pious Man, as appears by the many excellent Epiſtles which he wrote upon ſeveral oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. The ſecond was <hi>Leontius,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended likewiſe to Poſterity for an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Man, and a good Scholar. The third
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:37155:55"/>was <hi>Doſitheus,</hi> who was much inferiour to the two former both for Piety and Learning, and being offered the Patriarch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> by <hi>Iſaac</hi> the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Emperour, he attempted to graſp at both, and by that means held neither, but between two Patriarchal Chairs fell ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverably to the ground.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Antioch</hi> likewiſe we find ſeveral Greek Patriarchs, whereof one, whoſe name was <hi>Sotericus,</hi> being diſplaced for ſeveral Heretical Tenets which he held concerning our Saviour, he was ſucceeded by <hi>Theodorus Balſamon,</hi> who was in his time the very Oracle of the Civil Law, compiling and publiſhing many Learned Commentaries upon the Ancient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, wherein he proved the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to have greater privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges than the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> catching, ſay the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> at every thing that ſounded to the advancing of the Eaſtern Churches, and the pulling down <hi>Rome,</hi> when ſhe lifts up her Head above <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> for which reaſon <hi>Bellar min</hi> will not allow him to be a good Author. This <hi>Balſamon</hi> was likewiſe deceived by <hi>Iſaac</hi> the <hi>Grecian</hi> Emperour, who pretended that he would remove him to <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> upon condition he could prove the Tranſlation of Patriarchs to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:37155:55"/>in regard the Canons forbid it; but having performed the task, the Emperour, who was very mutable in his mind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed the Patriarchs place upon another, and left <hi>Balſamon</hi> to remain ſtill at <hi>Antioch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There being about this time a Truce between the Turks and Chriſtians, and <hi>Saladine</hi>'s Mother, ſuppoſing her ſelf ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently guarded thereby, adventuring to travel from <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> with abundance of Treaſure, and a very ſmall Train, ſhe was, notwithſtanding the Truce, ſurprized, and riffled of all ſhe had by <hi>Reinold</hi> of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> which baſe and unchriſtian act ſo inraged <hi>Saladine,</hi> that gathering together all his ſtrength, he immediately beſieged <hi>Ptolemais.</hi> And the Earl of <hi>Tripoli</hi> vext at his loſing the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, was ſo blinded by paſſion, and filled with rage againſt King <hi>Guy,</hi> that he miſtook his Enemy, and revenged himſelf on God and Religion, by baſely revolting with his whole Principality (which was a third part of the Kingdom of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) to <hi>Saladine,</hi> and aſſiſting him in that Siege.</p>
               <p>But the Knights Templars and Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallers ſallying out, &amp; falling on the <hi>Turks</hi> in their Camp, killed 20000 thouſand of them, but not without ſome loſs to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; the Maſter of the Hoſpitallers,

He was Son to <hi>Boniface</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> who was taken Priſoner in that Fatal Battle wherein King <hi>Guy</hi> loſt himſelf and his Kingdom. His Youth was for the moſt part ſpent in the Service of <hi>Iſaaccius An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelus</hi> the <hi>Grecian</hi> Emperour; who being bred in a Monaſtery, the confining of his Body ſeemed to have brought him to a pent and narrow Soul, and indued him with Accompliſhments more becoming a Prieſt than a Prince: For when his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Subjects affronted him to the face, inſtead of ſending an Army againſt them, to reduce them to their obedience he only committed his cauſe to a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:37155:59"/>of Bald-pated Friers, whom he kept in his Court, to pray for his Proſperity; Hoping that, by their ſuppoſed Pious Tears, he ſhould be able to quench the Combuſtions of his Empire. But this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade</hi> told him plainly, that if ever he intended to ſit upon the Imperial Throne in Peace, he muſt make uſe of the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of the left Hand, as well as thoſe of the right, and Fight as well as Pray. Which advice being taken by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, he did, by the help of this General, quickly ſubdue all his Enemies: But our brave <hi>Conrade</hi> found but a ſmall reward for ſo great a ſervice, being only graced, in conſideration thereof, to wear his Shoes of the Imperial Faſhion; And it being uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al with Princes, not to love the ſight of thoſe to whom they know themſelves obliged, and yet care not to reward, <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accius,</hi> by the perſwaſion of ſome about him, who envied his Courage and Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, ſpurred on <hi>Conrade,</hi> who was free e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of himſelf to any Noble Enterprize, to go into <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and endeavour to ſupport the ruinous affairs of the afflicted Chriſtians. And although he was ſenſible of their Plot yet, being weary of the <hi>Grecians</hi> baſeneſs, he ſuffered himſelf to be prevailed upon to undertake that Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Imployment, and therefore ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:37155:59"/>with all convenient ſpeed, for the Holy Land, with a gallant Band of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, who fitted out themſelves at their own charge, wherewith he march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the City of <hi>Tyre,</hi> where we will leave him for the preſent, to return again to <hi>Saladine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Who having won the City, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed himſelf of the greateſt part of the Kingdom of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> laid cloſe Siege to the City of <hi>Askelon,</hi> which had refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſurrender, when <hi>Ptolemais</hi> and the reſt yielded to his victorious Arms; but was now, after a ſhort Siege, delivered to him, upon condition that King <hi>Guy</hi> &amp; <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard,</hi> Maſters of the Templars, ſhould be ſett at Liberty And ſhortly after the Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Antioch</hi> was betrayed to him by the Patriarch: And <hi>Antioch</hi> it ſelf, which coſt the Chriſtians 11 Months Siege was by that means loſt in an inſtant, beſides ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Provinces thereunto belonging, &amp; Five &amp; Twenty ſtrong Towns more, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the like Fate with <hi>Antioch,</hi> and fell into the Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Turks.</hi> After which he ſat down likewiſe before <hi>Tripo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li,</hi> but that City being, after the death of Earl <hi>Reimond,</hi> delivered to the Chriſtians by his Wife, they Bravely defended it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all <hi>Saladines</hi> Force, ſo that having once taſted of their Valour in <hi>Tripoli</hi> he
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:37155:60"/>had no great Stomach to make a ſecond trial, but raiſed his Siege, and marched away to <hi>Tyre,</hi> where he hoped to ſpeed better. But he found himſelf greatly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, for <hi>Conrade</hi> being a little before got thither with his Army, gave him ſo hot a Welcome that he was glad to fly, and leave all his Tents behind him, which were ſufficiently lined with Treaſure, whereby the Chriſtians had the happineſs to inrich themſelves with their own Spoil.</p>
               <p>Thoſe in the City over-joyed at their great deliverance, choſe <hi>Conrade</hi> to be King of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſwearing Fealty to him, and promiſing to be for ever his Subjects, whoſe Valour had preſerved them from being <hi>Saladines</hi> Slaves. And the better to ſtrengthen his Title he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>Eliſa,</hi> or, as others call her, <hi>Iſabella,</hi> Siſter to <hi>Baldwin</hi> the fourth, and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to King <hi>Almerick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that King <hi>Guy,</hi> who was about this time delivered out of Priſon having, when he was releaſed, ſworn never more to bear Arms againſt <hi>Saladine</hi> (which Oath the Clergy judged void, becauſe forced from him when detained in Priſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to promiſe) obtained his Liberty, but could not get his Kingdom: For com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Tyre,</hi> he found the Gates ſhut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and his Subjects refuſing to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:37155:60"/>acknowledge any other King then <hi>Conrade.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Guy,</hi> packing up a Cloth of Remnants, with his broken Army, went and beſieged <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> the <hi>Piſans, Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> and <hi>Florentines,</hi> with their Sea-For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, aſſiſting him therein; But it went on notwithſtanding ſo ſlowly, that it could hardly be perceived to have made any advance in a Twelve Months time.</p>
               <p>Things going thus wofully to wrack in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> the Chriſtians ſighs there alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Brethren in <hi>Europe,</hi> to repair thither to their Succour, and among the reſt <hi>Frederick Barbaroſſa,</hi> Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> moved by the ſtrength of his Devotion, undertook a Voyage thither, when he was Seventy Years old, having one foot in the Grave, and yet adventure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with the other, to go on Pilgrimage. He had been long chained to the Stake, as it were, and baited by ſeveral ſucceſſive Popes, till at length wearied with their continual worrying of him, he gave up himſelf wholly to their direction, and was ſent by Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the third, on this Errand into the Holy Land.</p>
               <p>And having made great Preparations for this Adventure, he marched through <hi>Hungary,</hi> with a gallant Army of an Hundred and Fifty Thouſand Valiant Men, being kindly received and Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:37155:61"/>by King <hi>Bela.</hi> But changing his Hoſt, he changed his Entertainment to being baſely uſed as he paſſed through the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire: Inſomuch that <hi>Frederick,</hi> contrary to his expectation, finding ſuch perfidious dealing from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> drew his Sword, and reſolving to fight his way through, took <hi>Philippople, Adrianople,</hi> and divers other Citys, not ſo much to get their Spoil, as to ſecure his paſſage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Paleſtine.</hi> But when <hi>Iſaaccius</hi> ſaw that thoſe Pilgrims would either find or force their paſſage, he left off all terms of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and preſently accommodated them with all things neceſſary for their Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſportation over the <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to haſten them away, becauſe the Chriſtians Exigencies in <hi>Paleſtine</hi> admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of no delay; although it was really the effect of his fear, the <hi>Greeks</hi> ever lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Latin,</hi> beſt when they were fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt off.</p>
               <p>Old <hi>Frederick,</hi> having now left the treacherous <hi>Grecian</hi> Shore, and entred into the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Territories, found great reſiſtance from the <hi>Sultan</hi> of <hi>Iconium,</hi> whom he vanquiſhed, and overcame in four ſeveral Battles; And then, beſieging the City of <hi>Iconium,</hi> he took it by force and gave the Spoil of it to his Souldiers, to revenge the injury done by that <hi>Sultan</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:37155:61"/>to his Uncle <hi>Conrade</hi> the Emperour: And removing from thence to <hi>Philomela,</hi> he took that likewiſe, razing it to the ground, and executing the Inhabitants therein, as Rebels againſt the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for killing his Ambaſſadors; after which he paſſed with much difficulty, but more honour, into <hi>Syria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saladine</hi> ſhook for fear at the rumor of his coming, and thought it beſt to follow the advice of <hi>Charatux,</hi> his chief Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, who was at that time accounted one of the wiſeſt men in the world, tho his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was mean and contemptible, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantled all his Citys, in the Holy Land, except his Frontire Towns that ſo they might not be tenable with an Army, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſt, if the <hi>Germans</hi> won thoſe places, it would be no eaſy matter to drive them out again, but being naked from ſhelter, he thought he ſhould ſoon weary them with ſet Battles, in regard he had Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers without number, and thoſe near at hand.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Frederick,</hi> ſoon after he was entered into the Holy Land, was ſuddenly taken away being, to the great grief of all Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, unhappily drowned in the River of <hi>Saleph;</hi> the occaſion whereof is vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly reported by Hiſtorians, but they all agree that there he loſt his Life, and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:37155:62"/>ſome of them, pretending to acquaint the World with the reaſon why the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty permitted this Fatal Accident, tell us, that it was becauſe he had, in his Younger Years, fought againſt the Popes, and Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> But ſeeing ſo great an Emperour drowned in a ſhallow River, it was a great piece of audacious boldneſs in them, to adventure into the fathom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs depths of Gods ſecret Council: Let it ſuffice therefore for us to know that he who diſpoſes of all humane affairs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own Arbitrary Pleaſure, ſometimes blaſts the faireſt hopes, and makes the Feet of Monarchs to ſlip, juſt when they are ſtepping into their Enemies Throne.</p>
               <p>After his death <hi>Frederick</hi> Duke of <hi>Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:37155:62"/>them to retire. Then <hi>Frederick</hi> ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the City of <hi>Antioch,</hi> had it preſently delivered to him, where his hungry Souldiers being well refreſhed by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens who were yet for the moſt part Chriſtians, he marched forth in Battle Array, and meeting with <hi>Dodequin,</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of <hi>Saladines</hi> forces, he gave him a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty overthrow, wherein he ſlew four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand upon the place, and took a thouſand <hi>Turks</hi> Priſoners, with little or no loſs to himſelf. After which he went to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Tyre,</hi> in the Cathedral Church whereof he buried the Corps of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and warlike Father, near the Tomb of the Learned <hi>Origen:</hi> His Funeral Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon being preached by the worthy Arch-biſhop <hi>Gulielmus</hi> of <hi>Tyre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So ſoon as the Emperors Funeral Rites were ſolemnly performed, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed by Sea to the Chriſtian Army before <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> where young <hi>Frederick</hi> died of the Plague, and all his huge Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which at their ſetting out of <hi>Germany</hi> conſiſted of an hundred and fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, were now reduced to eighteen hundred onely</p>
               <p>And thus, by following this numerous Army to their graves, we have once again overtaken the tedious and ſlow-paced ſiege of <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> before which place
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:37155:63"/>lay an Army that was, as it were, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment of the Chriſtian World, there being ſcarce a petty ſtate or populous City in <hi>Europe,</hi> that had not ſome repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives there. So that there were many bloody Blowes lent on both ſides, &amp; repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again with intereſt in innumerable Sallys, fierce Aſſaults, and bloody En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters. The Chriſtians lying between <hi>Saladine</hi> and the City were beſieged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whilſt they beſieged <hi>Ptolemais.</hi> It was at laſt propoſed by <hi>Saladine,</hi> that both ſides ſhould try their fortune in the field, which was eaſily aſſented to by the Chriſtians, in hopes that they ſhould thereby both obtain the victory and win the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which they concluded would not hold out long, if <hi>Saladine</hi> were beaten. But when they were going to ingage, an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary fear ſuddenly ſeizing them, they all turned their backs and fled; So waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are the Scales of Victory, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the leaſt mote will turn them. In which confuſion many would have thought themſelves happy if they could have exchanged a ſtrong Hand, for a ſwift Foot. But <hi>Geoffrey Luſignan,</hi> Brother to King <hi>Guy,</hi> who was left to guard the Camp, ſeeing the Chriſtians ſhamefully to run away, marched out with his men to meet them, and having convinced them of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:37155:63"/>the cauſeleſsneſs of their fear, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with them to return again, they ſet upon the <hi>Turks</hi> with ſo much fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and rage, that they quickly won the day, though it coſt them the loſs of two thouſand men, and <hi>Gerard</hi> Maſter of the Templars.</p>
               <p>After this victory it was vainly expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Chriſtians, that the City would preſently be ſurrendred to them, but the <hi>Turks</hi> ſtill continued to defend it with much reſolution, though moſt of their houſes were already burnt, or beaten down, and the whole City reduced to a perfect Sceleton of Walls and Towers. They fought with their wits as well as with their weapons, &amp; both ſides employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves in deviſing ſtrange &amp; hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to unknown offenſive &amp; defenſive Engines: So that <hi>Mars</hi> himſelf, had he reſided either in that Camp or City, might have learnt to fight and have informed himſelf in feats of war, from their practice. But in the mean time famine raged exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Chriſtian Camp, in regard they had no proviſion but what they were forced to ſend for, as far as <hi>Italy.</hi>

               <p>In the mean while the Plague and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine raged in the Chriſtian Camp, and in the compaſs of one year, had ſwept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way above Fifty Princes and Prelates of note, who together with all the reſt of the common Souldiers, in the opinion of thoſe who wrote the Hiſtory of that Siege, went undoubtedly to Heaven; Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were before Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the ſixth, had commanded the Angels, (who durſt not diſobey him,) to convey every Soul into Paradice, which ſhould die in their Pilgrimage.</p>

               <p>But that which moſt obſcured the Glory of this Victory was the Chriſtians being tent aſunder with Faction, and divided among themſelves. King <hi>Philip,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Auſtria,</hi> moſt of the <hi>Dutch</hi> and all the <hi>Genoans</hi> and <hi>Templars,</hi> fiding with King <hi>Conrade,</hi> and King <hi>Richard, Henry</hi> Count of <hi>Champaigne,</hi> with the Hoſpitallers, the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and <hi>Piſans,</hi> taking part with <hi>Guy. Conrades</hi> ſide was very much weakned, by the ſudden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of the <hi>French</hi> King, who eighteen days, after the taking of <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> returned home, pretending want of neceſſaries, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition of body through the diſtemper of the Climate: but the true cauſe was his not induring to hear King <hi>Richards</hi> Fame ſo much tranſcend his own, together with a deſire to ſeize on the Dominions of the Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> who was then lately dead.</p>
               <p>His own Souldiers mightily diſſwaded him from returning, and beſought him not to ſtop in ſo glorious a work, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he had proſpered ſo well already, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

And at his departure he left his inſtructions, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his Army, to the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> ordering him to move as ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as poſſible, in advancing that work, wherein the King of <hi>England</hi> would have all the Honour, which rendred this great undertaking leſs advantagious to the Chriſtians in <hi>Syria,</hi> than otherwiſe it might have been.</p>

He had Reigned about five years, and left ont Daughter, <hi>Maria Jole,</hi> on whom the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plers beſtowed Princely Education.</p>
               <p>But tho' <hi>Conrade</hi> was Dead, his Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtill ſurvived, and thoſe of his party affronted King <hi>Guy,</hi> and ſtrove to have him depoſed; telling him, that the Crown was only tyed on his Head with a Womans Fillet, which being now bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, by the Death of Queen <hi>Sibyl</hi> who dyed together with all her Children, of the Plague at the Siege of <hi>Ptolomais,</hi> he had no longer any Right to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, eſpecially, being a worthleſs and an unfortunate man: Tho' the truth is, the meaſuring a Princes worth by his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, is a Rule often falſe, and always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain; and the common Conſent of all
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:37155:69"/>Nations will plead this in his Favour, that having been once a King, he ought ever to remain ſo. But to put a ſinal end to this unhappy Controverſie, King <hi>Richard</hi> made a pleaſing Motion, which relliſhed well to the Palate of that hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Prince, offering him the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> in exchange for his Kingdom of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Which motion was willingly imbraced, and the exchange actually made, to the Content of both parties, and the Kings of <hi>England</hi> bore the Title of King of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in their ſtyle, for many years after. But in this exchange, <hi>Guy</hi> had really the better Bargain, in regard he bought a real Poſſeſſion for an Airy Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: However, he lived not long to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it, for he dyed ſoon after his Arrival there, but his Family injoyed it, for ſome hundred years, after which it fell by ſome Tranſaction, to the ſtate of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice;</hi> and was at laſt wreſted from them by the <hi>Turks,</hi> who injoy it at this day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conrade</hi> being killed, and <hi>Guy</hi> having renounced his Kingdom. <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Champaign</hi> was advanced to the Kingdom of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> by the procurement of King <hi>Richard</hi> his Uncle, who to corroborate his Election, by ſome Right of Succeſſion, married <hi>Iſabella</hi> the Widow of <hi>Conrade,</hi> and Daughter of <hi>Almerick</hi> King of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:37155:70"/>he was a Prince valiant enough, but in regard his Reign was ſhort, and moſt of it ſpent in a Truce; he had not an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to expreſs it: He took more delight in the ſtyle of Prince of <hi>Tyre,</hi> then he did in that, of being King of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as accounting it more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, to be Prince of what he had, then to be called King of what he injoyed not.</p>
               <p>And now the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> promiſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves abundance of Peace and Tranquility, began every where to build, and to beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie their Habitations.

And our Royal Pilgrim in this Battel was ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventrous, and fought with ſuch invincible Courage, and Reſolution againſt thoſe Enemies of Chriſtianity, that his Valour brought his Judgment into queſtion, in regard he was more careleſs of himſelf, and expoſed his Perſon to greater danger, then beſeemed the prudence of a General; for having received a Wound, as tho' by loſing his Blood, he had received a new Addition to his Strength, he laid about him like a Mad-man, killing divers of the Infidels with his own hands. The <hi>Turks</hi> withſtood the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> force for a long time, and ſtrove hard to carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Honour of the Day; but were at laſt forced to give Ground, and leave the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the Poſſeſſion of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, which they obtained with little or no loſs to themſelves, ſave <hi>James</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergn,</hi>

               <p>And had the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> improved this Victory, and marched immediately to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> they might in all Probability have ſurprized it, whilſt the <hi>Turks</hi> were Blind-folded, and in a kind of a maze at this Prodigious overthrow: But the opportunity was wholly loſt by the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs of King <hi>Richard</hi> and his <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Soldiers, ſay the <hi>French</hi> Writers, whilſt others impute it, altogether to the Envy, and Emulation of the <hi>French,</hi> who rather choſe to have ſo Glorious an Action left undone, then to ſee it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> together with the Treachery of <hi>Odo</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> who being more grieved for the loſs of his Credit, than careful to preſerve a good Conſcience, was choaked with the ſhame of the ſin which he had ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and dyed for Grief, that his hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Correſpondence with the <hi>Turks,</hi> came to be diſcovered: But moſt are of the Opinion, that <hi>Richard</hi> attempted not the taking of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> becauſe like a wiſe Architect, he intended to build his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories, ſo as they might ſtand unſhaken, by ſecuring the Country all along as he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37155:71"/>went. It being Senſleſs and Imprudent to beſiege <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> an In-land City, whilſt the <hi>Turks</hi> were ſtill in Poſſeſſion of all the Sea-Ports, and other places of Strength thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Sometime after this Victory, he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted divers Camels laden with very rich Commodities; thoſe <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Wars containing a great deal of Treaſure in a little Room. And yet of all this, and of all that abundance of Wealth of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Sicily</hi> and <hi>Cyprus,</hi> which he brought hither, he carried nothing home, ſave only one Gold-Ring, all the reſt being melted away, and conſumed in this hot Service.</p>
               <p>He ſpent the Winter at <hi>Askelon,</hi> and intended the following Spring to have gone to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> had not bad News out of <hi>Europe</hi> altered his reſolution, and put him in mind of returning home. <hi>William</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> whom he had left his Vice-Roy in <hi>England,</hi> uſed many unſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Inſolencies towards his Subjects: So hard and difficult a thing it is, for one of a mean and Contemptible Birth, to perſonate a King without going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his Limits, and over Acting his part. And that which was yet worſe, his Brother <hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> had conſpired with the <hi>French</hi> King to invade
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37155:72"/>his Dominions. Which reports, and the concluding of this War, (a Subject not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to anſwer the expence and Charge of of it; eſpecially, now the <hi>Venetians, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noans, Piſans</hi> and <hi>Florentines</hi> were gone away with their Fleet; wiſely ſhrinking themſelves out of the Collar, when they found their Necks too much Galled with their hard imployment;) made him deſire a Peace of <hi>Saladine,</hi> who thereby finding, that he had all the Cords in his own hands, knew well enough how to play his Game, and make his beſt of thoſe Exigencies wherein he knew King <hi>Richard</hi> to be plunged; for he had thoſe about him, who had cunning and skill enough, to read in King <hi>Richards</hi> Face what griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and perplexed his mind, and knew by his Spies every thing, that was worth Obſervation in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army. He offered therefore to Conſent, that a Truce ſhould be concluded on for three (ſome ſay five) years, upon condition that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> would demoliſh all places which they had fortified ſince the tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> which was in Effect to be at the Charge of undoing all that they had hitherto done. But however ſuch was the urgency of King <hi>Richards</hi> occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that he was glad to accept of thoſe hard Conditions, tho' he hated them at his Heart.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:37155:72"/>
               <p>And thus this great undertaking of thoſe two mighty and Warlike Kings, began with great Confidence, managed with much Courage, and attended with good Succeſs, ended, notwithſtanding with ſome Honour indeed to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, but no manner of Profit, either to themſelves, or the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> cauſe.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Richard</hi> in this Voyage eternized his Memory, and to the Glory of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, render'd his Name ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to the <hi>Turks,</hi> that they were uſed to ſay to their Horſes when they ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for fear, what doſt thou think King <hi>Richard</hi> is here? But Profit, neither he, nor the <hi>French</hi> King got any, both of them looſing the Hair of their Head in an acute diſeaſe, which ſaith, one Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian was more then either of them got by the Voyage. And as for the poor <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> they left them in a far worſe Caſe than they found them.</p>
               <p>But to refreſh the Readers Spirits a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, amidſt ſo many Miſeries and ſad Stories, I muſt not omit one thing that King <hi>Richard</hi> did in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> which was no doubt, an abundant Compenſation for all the coſt and pains of his Journey: Which was his redeeming from the <hi>Turks</hi> for a great ſum of Money, a large Cheſt as much as four Men could lift, full of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37155:73"/>Holy Relicks, which precious Treaſure they had gotten from the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> at the taking of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>

               <p>King <hi>Richard</hi> having now ſigned the Peace with <hi>Saladine,</hi> and thereby ended his Pilgrimage, took Shipping in <hi>Syria</hi> to return to his Kingdom; but meeting with a Storm on the Coaſt of <hi>Germany,</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:37155:73"/>he ſuffered Shipwrack, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to travel through that Country by Land, as being his neareſt way home, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſidering that the nearneſs of the way ought to have been meaſured, not ſo much by the ſhortneſs of it, as the ſafeneſs of it.</p>
               <p>But however to prevent all danger, he diſguiſed himſelf, and pretended to be one <hi>Hugo</hi> a Merchant, whoſe only Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity was himſelf, whereof he made but a bad Bargain; for being diſcovered in <hi>Auſtria</hi> by his large Expences, which ſo far exceeded the degree of a Merchant, that his Hoſteſs detected him, and the common People flocking about him, uſed much Rudeneſs and Inſolence towards him. And being ſeized on by the Duke, who reſolved now to be revenged on him for the affront done him in <hi>Paleſtine;</hi> he ſold him to <hi>Henry</hi> the Emperor, who kept him in Bonds, Charging him with a Thouſand faults committed in <hi>Sicily, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus</hi> and <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> the Prooſs whereof were as ſlender as the Crime, were ſmall, ſo that <hi>Richard</hi> having an eloquent Tongue, an innocent Heart, and a bold Spirit, eaſily acquited himſelf of all thoſe furious Charges, in the Judgment of all that heard him. However before he could obtain his Liberty, he was forced to pay
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:37155:74"/>a Ranſom of an Hundred and Twenty Thouſand Marks <hi>Collen</hi> weight, which was in that age before the <hi>Indies</hi> had fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe Northern parts of the World, with Gold and Silver, ſo greata ſum that to raiſe it in <hi>England,</hi> they were forced to ſell all their Church Plate, and in lieu thereof for ſome Hundred years after, to Celebrate the Sacrament in Challices of Latten or Tin. After this Money <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Bloys</hi> (who had drank as deep of this <hi>Helicon,</hi> as any of that age,) ſent this Prayer, making an Apoſtrophe to the Emperor, or to the Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> or to both together.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>And now thou baſeſt <hi>Avarice,</hi>

               <p>Part of this Ranſome being paid, and Hoſtages left for the ſecuring the reſt, he returned into <hi>England,</hi> having indured Eighteen Months Impriſonment. But the Duke was after this ſorely aflicted in his Dominions, by Fire and Famine, And in his Body by a Gangren, which ſeiſed on him with that Violence that he
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:37155:74"/>was forced to cut his leg off with his own hand, and died thereof; but before his death he fortified <hi>Vienna</hi> with a ſtrong Wall, which he cauſed to be built with this Money, and being in the time of his ſickneſs, troubled in conſcience for having been ſo Cruel to our King, he will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome Thouſand Crowns to be returned to him again.</p>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:37155:81"/>Reign of King <hi>Almerick,</hi> to the great annoyance of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but tho' they were unſucceſsful in this ſiege, yet King <hi>John</hi> was more fortunate in taking the Caſtle of <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> a piece of great ſtrength on the Sea ſide.</p>
               <p>Whereupon it was reſolved on to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the War into <hi>Egypt,</hi> in hope to diſcourage the <hi>Egyptians</hi> by the Invaſion, and ruine of their Country; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Hoiſting Sail, they came before <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miata</hi> a chief Haven of <hi>Egypt,</hi> lying on the <hi>Eaſt</hi> ſide of the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> In the ſiege whereof they had four difficulties to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with, beſides the City it ſelf, firſt with a great Chain that lay a croſs the Harbor which with indefatigable pains and Induſtry mingled with Art they break aſunder. Secondly the River <hi>Nilus</hi> which now ſuddenly, and unexpectedly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed, and drowned the whole Country, ſo that the Fiſh came ſwimming into the <hi>Christians</hi> Tents, and againſt which miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief they had no other defence but Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and a publick Faſt enjoyned by the Legate, upon which the water abated, and a Publick Thankſgiving thereupon injoyned, that ſo the mercy obtained by Prayer might be kept by Praiſe. Thirdly, they were to grapple with the Fort of <hi>Pharria,</hi> A ſeeming Impregnable
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:37155:81"/>Piece between them and <hi>Damiata;</hi> for the taking whereof they built a Tower on Ships, which falling down killed and wounded many of the <hi>Pilgrims:</hi> and thoſe who had the good hap to eſcape the blow, were notwithſtanding terrified by the fright which the fall occaſioned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, but King <hi>John</hi> comforted his Soldiers, and deſired them not to be diſcouraged at a thing which was purely accidental, and againſt which there could be no guard or defence by any rules of Wiſdom or Valour, but immediately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs themſelves to the Raiſing one more ſubſtantial, by his direction and advice, which was when finiſhed the rarieſt piece in that kind, that ever the world ſaw, by means whereof after many bloody af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faults they Conquered the Fort.</p>
               <p>And the fourth and wonſt enemy they had to do withal, was <hi>Meladine</hi> King of <hi>Egypt</hi> who lay near them with a great Army, Conſtantly furniſhing the City with Men and Victuals, and excerciſing them with continual Skirmiſhes, in one whereof he did them abundance of harm with his Wild fire, whereby King <hi>John</hi> himſelf was dangerouſly Scorched, but at laſt ſeeing that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> hewed their way through all thoſe Rocks of difficulties, he propounded a Peace to them,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:37155:82"/>by the mediation of his Brother <hi>Coradine</hi> King of <hi>Damalcus,</hi> wherein he offered, that if they would depart out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he would reſtore them the <hi>Croſs,</hi> the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and all the Land of <hi>Paleſtine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Engliſh, French,</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> were willing to imbrace ſo large an offer, but the Legate would no ways conſent, alledging that the Voyage was undertaken not for the recovery of <hi>Paleſtine</hi> only, but for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of the <hi>Mahometan Religion,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his Maſters Intereſt to keep that War always on foot: Which refuſal ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged <hi>Coradine,</hi> that he beat down the Walls of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and all the Beautifull Buildings therein, ſave only the Tower of <hi>David,</hi> and the Temple of the <hi>Sepulcher.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However the ſiege of <hi>Damiata</hi> went on, and was at length taken by the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> without reſiſtance; moſt of thoſe that ſhould have defended it being either ſlain, or dead with the Famine or Plague, ſo that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who inraged with the length of the ſiege, entred with a reſolution to kill all, had their fury ſoon melted into pitty, by beholding the ſtreets every where ſtrewed with dead Corps, ſo that of threeſcore and ten Thouſand there was now but one thouſand remain'd alive, who were all pardoned by the Conquerors; upon Condition that they
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:37155:82"/>would cleanſe the City, which they were three Months in performing.</p>
               <p>Great was the ſpoil, the Pilgrims found in <hi>Damiata,</hi> being as it were a ſtrong barred Cheſt, wherein the Merchants of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>India</hi> had as they imagined, ſafely Locked up all their Treaſures, which detained them there a full year, being moſt of them Content to make that Inn their home; during which time, the Pope ordered <hi>John de Columna</hi> a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, to reſide there, as his Legate in the place of <hi>Pelagius.</hi>

               <p>NOt long after, the Arrival of this new Legate, there aroſe a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between him and the King of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in regard he Challenged <hi>Dami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atia</hi> for his Holineſs, which had at the taking of it by publick Agreement been aſſigned to the King: Whereupon <hi>Bren</hi> in anger returned to <hi>Ptolomais,</hi> as well to puff out his diſcontent in private, as
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:37155:83"/>to teach the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> his worth by their want of him, who preſently after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture found themſelves at ſo great a loſs, that they were neither able to ſtand ſtill without diſgrace, nor proceed in the War without danger. The Legate commanded them to march, but he found they had too great a Spirit to be ruled by a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; for they ſwore they would not ſtir one ſtep, unleſs the King were with them: So that the Legate was fain to ſend Meſſengers to intreat his return to the Army, which at laſt he Conſented to, by the perſwaſion of the Meſſengers, and a promiſe of having <hi>Damatia</hi> according to the firſt Agreement.</p>
               <p>But no ſooner was the King and the Legate met again, after eight Months ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, but new Diviſions were ſtarted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. The Legate perſwaded the Army to march up, and beſiege <hi>Grand Cairo;</hi> aſſuring them, that they might thereby quickly command all <hi>Egypt:</hi> God having as he pretended, opened them ſuch a door of victory, that they might eaſily enter into Poſſeſſion of their Enemies Country, if they did not bar it up by their own Idleneſs.</p>
               <p>But the King oppoſed it, and adviſed them to return again into <hi>Syria,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that City was difficult to take, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:37155:83"/>impoſſible to keep, the Ground whereon they were to march was altogether as Treacherous as the People, againſt whom they were to fight; ſo that it was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for them, now to retire with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, then hereafter to fly with ſhame. But the Legate perſiſting in his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thundred out Excommunications a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all thoſe who refuſed to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; therefore they muſt needs go, when the Devil drove them.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the crafty <hi>Egyptians,</hi> whoſe flight was more to be feared, then their fight; ſeeing the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> advance, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to fly before them, the better to draw them into the Snare. But the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate fancying, that the pretended flight was the Effect of their Cowardize and Fear, hugged himſelf in his own Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Happineſs, and highly applauded his Sagacity, in giving that Succeſsful advice, tho' he quickly found his Joy tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into Sorrow.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Egypt</hi> being a low level Ground, through the midſt whereof runs the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Nilus;</hi> whoſe ſtream the <hi>Egyptians</hi> had by their Induſtry, ſo bridled with Banks and Sluces, that they could eaſily Command it, to be their own Servant, and their Enemies Maſter. And therefore, when the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> had Confidently march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:37155:84"/>on without the leaſt Suſpicion, till it was impoſſible for them, either to retire or be relieved; the <hi>Turks</hi> pierced their Banks, and let the River run open mouthed upon them, yet ſo, as they only drowned them up to the middle, reſerving their Lives for the Ranſome of <hi>Damatia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that there you might have the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> in an inſtant turned into a Sea; and an Army of ſixty thouſand, as the Neck of one Man ſtreached on the Block, and expecting the fatal blow; every one Curſed the Legate, and blamed their own folly, in complying with the Advice of a Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and neglecting that of a King. But it was now too late, to complain; and they muſt bear with Patience the Miſery, which they had brought upon themſelves by their own Raſhneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Meladine</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſeeing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable Miſery of thoſe drowned <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> and the Conſtancy, and Patience wherewith they indured their Calamity, was moved with Compaſſion towards them; being himſelf as was thought, ſomewhat inclined to ibrace the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, and offered them their Lives upon condition, that they would quit the Country and reſtore <hi>Dami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ata.</hi> They glady accepted the conditions, and preſently diſpatched Meſſengers to the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:37155:84"/>City, to prepare them for the Surrender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, but they within the City being themſelves ſafe on the ſhore, knew not how to ſimpathiſe with their Poor Brethren in Shipwrack, and therefore told the Meſſengers that thoſe drowned <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims</hi> deſerved no pity, in regard they had invited this miſery upon themſelves by their own raſhneſs, and that if they yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up this City for nothing, which coſt ſo many Lives, they ſhould thereby expoſe themſelves to the deriſion of the whole World; that if thoſe <hi>Pilgrims</hi> periſhed, more might be had, but no more <hi>Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta's,</hi> it being a place of ſuch Importance that it would always be a curb to the excurſions of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> King, but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thoſe poor diſtreſſed wretches had ſome friends in the City, who confeſſed that the Voyage was indeed undertaken unadviſedly, and was juſtly to be blamed, but yet pleaded that worſe and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate projects had ſome times been undertaken by others, and when they have been Crowned with Succeſs, have paſſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtioned, and ſo they ſuppoſed would this have done, had it Succeeded, and that therefore it was moſt unreaſonable to add miſery to the miſerable, beſeeching them to pity their Brethren, and not leave them in that forlorn ſtate.</p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:37155:85"/>
               <p>But finding their arguments to avail little, they betook themſelves to their Arms, reſolving to force the adverſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to reſign the City, and King <hi>John</hi> who of all others had the leaſt reaſon to pity them, in regard their project was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt his advice, was notwithſtanding ſo touched with a ſence of their calamity, that he generouſly threatned in caſe they refuſed to ſurrender it, to give <hi>Meladine, Ptolemais</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> in the ſtead of it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they conſented, and <hi>Damiata</hi> was reſtored to the <hi>Turks,</hi> and the Legate and his Army let out of the trap wherein they were taken, <hi>Meladine</hi> out of his Princely goodneſs furniſhing them with Victuals, and Horſes to carry their feeble perſons upon, and thus the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> received an overthrow without a wound, and the <hi>Turks</hi> obtained an abſolute Victory with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Blood.</p>
               <p>And there being at this time, beſides the agreement for the Exchange of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miata,</hi> a Peace made with the <hi>Turks</hi> for eight years, whereby things were ſetled in <hi>Syria,</hi> King <hi>John</hi> took a Journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was Honourably entertained by the Pope; And ſhortly after tho' for what reaſon I cannot find, he reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Kingdom of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Frode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> the ſecond Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>But that which kept both <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in awe, and made them the more carefull to obſerve the Truce, was their mutual fear of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> a fierce People which at this time took their firſt flight out of their own neſt into the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Countries, they were anciently called <hi>Scythians,</hi> and Inhabited the <hi>Northern</hi> parts of <hi>Aſia</hi> a country never Conquered by any of the Monarchs, being priviledged from their Victorious Arms by its own barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which was the reaſon why after they had made ſeveral incurſions into <hi>Europe,</hi>

               <p>They were by their multitudes and ferce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs become ſo formidable that the Pope himſelf began to fear them in <hi>Italy,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent which he ſent <hi>Askelin</hi> a Frier much famed in thoſe days, and three others to Convert them to the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, who inſtead of inſtructing them the Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> acquainted them with the greatneſs and power of the Pope, who was as he told them, exalted above all the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> but <hi>Baiothnoi</hi> Chief Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Army (for they were not admitted to the Great <hi>Cham</hi> himſelf) crying quits with this Frier, outvyed him in diſcribing his <hi>Cham,</hi> whoſe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Divinity he affirmed to exceed that of the Popes, and ſent him back with a blunt Letter, which he concluded thus, <hi>If thou wilt ſet upon our Land and Inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, it behoveth that Thou</hi> Pope <hi>in thy proper Perſon come unto us, and that Thou come to him who containeth the Face of the Whole</hi> Earth, meaning their Great <hi>Cham.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>His Holineſs</hi> ſtormed exceedingly at this

               <p>This irrepairable rent and diviſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Churches was very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious to the <hi>Turks,</hi> and a greath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to the <hi>Holy War;</hi> for the <hi>Greeks</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> who had hitherto lived in ſome kind of friendly correſpondency with the <hi>Latins,</hi> differing indeed in Judgment, but complying in Affections, and uniting againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> the common Enemy of both, began now to conceive ſo great a hatered for the <hi>Latins,</hi> that they wiſhed the <hi>Turk,</hi> from whom they expected fair Quarter, the free Exerciſe of their Religion, and a ſecure dwelling in any City, for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſet Tribute, might conquer rather than their fellow Chriſtians, from whom

               <p>Fifteen days after his departure, <hi>Richard,</hi> Earl of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and Brother to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, landed at <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by <hi>Theodoricus,</hi> Lord Prior of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hoſpitallers, divers Barons, and an Army of brave and well-appointed Soldiers, where he was joyfully received, eſpecially by the Clergy, who Sang at his arrival, <hi>Bleſſed is he who cometh in the Name of the Lord.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Not long after the Earls return, died <hi>Reinoldus, Frederick</hi>'s Lieutenant in <hi>Syria,</hi> in whoſe Grave was buried all the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Glory of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in <hi>Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine.</hi> For now the lawleſs <hi>Templars</hi> would obſerve no other Rule than their own Will, and the inundation of the rude <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi> having, maugre all oppoſition, run over all the North of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and forced many Nations to forſake their ancient Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations; among whom was a certain People, called <hi>Coraſine,</hi> who being thus unkennelled, had recourſe to the Sultan of <hi>Babylon,</hi> deſiring him to give them a place to live in. The Sultan, who was free
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:37155:92"/>enough of that which was none of his own, frankly gave them all the Land that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> held in <hi>Syria,</hi> upon condition, that they would conquer it; which he told them was eaſie to do, in regard the People were few and weak, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try rich and fruitful.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Coraſines</hi> being thus animated by the by the Sultan, came with their Wives and Children and their whole Houſholds into <hi>Syria,</hi> to win Houſes and Land for them there. And finding the City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> unguarded, and without the leaſt ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Enemy, eaſily ſurprized it, and entered without reſiſtance.

               <p>Things being brought to this paſs in <hi>Syria,</hi> a deſperate Diſeaſe muſt have a deſperate Remedy, whereupon the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> clapt up a haſty Peace with the two Sultans of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> and <hi>Cracci,</hi> between

And ſwearing them to be faithful, borrowed an Army of their Forces, to aſſiſt them in taking vengeance on the <hi>Coraſines.

               <p>So that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were beaten by a beaten People, who ſhortly after falling out with the Sultan of <hi>Babylon,</hi> were by him wholly routed out, ſo as none of their Name remained. And it is very obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable,

               <p>Thither alſo the <hi>Templers,</hi> who were afraid of being checked by this Pious King for their debauched Lives, wrote to him to accept of a Peace, which the King of <hi>Egypt</hi> offered to make with the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</hi> But he being informed by the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> that it was only a trick of the <hi>Templers,</hi> to prevent his intentions of going into <hi>Syria,</hi> to behold their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, commanded the Grand Maſter, that from thence forward, upon the price of his Head, he ſhould receive no Meſſages, nor hold any correſpondence with the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,

                  <hi>Damiata</hi> was a City ſo ſtrong and well fortified, that the taking of it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a good Task, if performed by an Army within the compaſs of a Year. But thoſe within remembring the Miſeries of the laſt Siege, and fearing the ſame Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy would be acted over again, ſet fire to the Houſes, and in the Night ſaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by flight; whereupon the <hi>French</hi> iſſued in, and quenching the fire, ſaved abundance of Treaſure from the fury of the flames. Which Loſs ſo diſcouraged <hi>Meladine,</hi> that to purchaſe Peace with the <hi>Christians,</hi> he offered to reſtore them the whole Kingdom of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in as ample a manner as ever it had been enjoyed by any of their Predeceſſors, to releaſe all Priſoners, and disburſe a great Sum of Money to defray the Charge of the War. But ſuch was their Pride and Folly, that they refuſed to accept of it, unleſs <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> the beſt Port in all <hi>Egypt,</hi> were given them as an Over-plus; the Pope's Legate, and <hi>Robert,</hi> Earl of <hi>Artois,</hi> perſuading them to grant Peace upon no other terms. Wherefore the <hi>Turk</hi> ſeeing themſelves in ſo deſperate a condition, their Extremity rendered their Sword the keener, and made them provide with the greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to defend their Country to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt.</p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:37155:96"/>
               <p>About this time there aroſe a difference between the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to the great prejudice of their Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. And <hi>Meladine,</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> died likewiſe the ſame Year, and left his imbroiled Kingdom to <hi>Melcchſala,</hi> his Son.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Damiata</hi> the <hi>French</hi> marched up towards <hi>Cairo,</hi> the Governor whereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offended with the new King, promiſed to deliver it into their hands. And having paſſed an arm of the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> Earl <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> marched forward with a third part of the Army and ſuddenly aſſaulted the <hi>Turks</hi> in their Tents, whilſt the King was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and put them to flight; which Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory ſo lifted him up with conceit, that he adventured contrary to the advice of the Maſter of the <hi>Templers,</hi> to ſet on the whole <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Power, which lay incamped not far off, without ſtaying for the reſt of the Army, whereby he was utterly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, and as he was croſſing the River, in his flight, found Water enough to drown him, tho' not to waſh away the ſtain of raſhneſs and cowardize from his memory; and our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Earl refuſing to fly, died fighting in the midſt of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, there eſcaping no more but four perſons to carry News of this fatal over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw to the reſt of the Army.</p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:37155:96"/>
               <p>It is eaſier for the Reader to conceive, than for my Pen to expreſs, the general grief wherewith theſe doleful Tydings were received by the <hi>French,</hi> among whom the Plague raged ſo furiouſly, that it daily ſwept away Thouſands. And to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their ſorrow, ſeveral ſick perſons, whom the King had ſent down the River to <hi>Damiata,</hi> were ſet upon by the <hi>Egyptian</hi> King, and having neither Hands to fight, nor Legs to run, were every one either burned or drowned, except <hi>Alexander Gifford,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi>-man, whoſe Name and Family ſtill remains at <hi>Chellingworth</hi> in <hi>Stafford-ſhire,</hi> who acquainted the <hi>French</hi> with what had happened. They would now have been glad of thoſe Terms, which a little before they ſlighted, but it was too late, for the <hi>Turks</hi> now ſcorned to treat with them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> would have had the King provided for his own ſafety, by flying back to <hi>Damiata.</hi> But he refuſed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to live or die, overcome or periſh with them, marched forward to the fatal place, where the laſt Battel was fought. And whilſt they were aſtoniſhed at the ſight of their mangled fellows, the <hi>Egyptian</hi> King ſet upon them with an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men, and put them all (being but few in number, and thoſe very weak) to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:37155:97"/>the ſword, except <hi>Lewis</hi> and his two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whom he took Priſoners.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> having thus ſlain all the <hi>French</hi> Pilgrims, inſtantly marched up with their Enſigns to <hi>Damiata,</hi> hoping thereby to ſurprize it, which if they had done, King <hi>Lewis</hi> had been for ever loſt. But God diſappointed them, for they were eaſily diſcovered, notwithſtanding their diſguiſe, and forced to go away without their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</p>
               <p>The News of this ſorrowful Accident coming to <hi>Europe,</hi> filled every one with grief, and made <hi>Henry,</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> who had made great preparation to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Voyage, to alter his mind, and imploy his Money to a better uſe.</p>
               <p>But to return to <hi>Egypt: Melechſala</hi> did not long ſurvive this Victory, being ſlain ſoon after by <hi>Tanquemine,</hi> a ſturdy <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maluke,</hi> who ſucceeded him in the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Kingdom, by whom King <hi>Lewis</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed, in exchange for <hi>Damiata;</hi> being obliged, beſides the ſurrender of the City, to pay many Thouſand Pounds for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſing of Chriſtian Captives, and to make ſatisfaction for the Damage done in <hi>Egypt;</hi> for the ſecuring whereof, he was forced to pawn to the <hi>Turks,</hi> the <hi>Pyx</hi> and <hi>Host:</hi> whence it is, that a Wafer-Cake and a Box is always wrote in the Borders of that

               </argument>
               <p>THoſe <hi>Mammalukes</hi> which had now ſeized on the Kingdom of <hi>Egypt</hi> were the Children of <hi>Christian</hi>-Parents, which were by <hi>Saladine</hi> and his Succeſſors taught the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Superſtition, and inſtructed in all Military Diſcipline at ſeveral Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, and being found by their Valour and Courage to be the chief ſupport of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Kings, were by them advanced to the chief places of profit and truſt, and thereby the better enabled to pull down their raiſers. Which was performed du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the captivity of King <hi>Lewis,</hi> by <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quemine,</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:37155:98"/>who ſlew <hi>Melechſala,</hi> and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it unfit ſo great a Prince ſhould go to the grave alone, ſent all his Children after him. And was afterwards choſen by the reſt of the <hi>Mammalukes,</hi> King of <hi>Egypt;</hi> whereupon he, by their advice and conſent, made ſeveral Laws, which were ever after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward obſerved by them as irrevokable, The firſt whereof was,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Sultan, or chief of the ſervile Empire, ſhould not ſucceed by Inheritance, but be choſen out of the</hi> Mammalukes.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, <hi>That none ſhould be admitted into the Order of the</hi> Mammalukes, <hi>that were born either of</hi> Turkiſh <hi>or</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Parents, but only ſuch as were born</hi> Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>The third was, <hi>That tho' the Sons of</hi> Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malukes <hi>ſhould injoy their Fathers Lands and Wealth, yet they ſhould not take upon them the Name and Honour of a</hi> Mammaluke.</p>
               <p>The fourth was, <hi>That the Native</hi> Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians <hi>ſhould be permitted the uſe of no other Weapons, but ſuch wherewith they were to fight against Weeds and Till and Manure their Land.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>There were in this Government ſeveral things worthy admiration.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That of Slaves they ſhould act the King, without playing the Tyrant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That they ſhould neglect their own Children when it is common for other men to idolize them and ſacrifice all that they have to their welfare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>That they ſhould not fall out in the Election of their Kings, in regard they were all equal among themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>That it ſhould indure ſo long, for it laſted Two hundred ſixty and ſeven Years, till overcome by</hi> Selimus, <hi>the great</hi> Turkiſh <hi>Emperour, in the Year</hi> 1517. <hi>by the help of the</hi> Janizaries, <hi>an Order of Men for Birth and Breeding not unlike themſelves.</hi>

               <p>In that Year likewiſe, it being a Year of great Revolutions, died <hi>Frederick,</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Germany</hi> and King of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whereupon followed an <hi>Interegnum</hi> in that Kingdom for fourteen Years together; the right indeed lay in <hi>Conrade, Frederick</hi>'s Son, by <hi>Jole,</hi> King <hi>John</hi>'s Daughter; but he was ſo imployed in defending himſelf

               <p>Near about this time a certain <hi>Hungari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Peaſant, ſaid to have been an Apoſtate to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and well learned, gathered together ſeveral Thouſand people, who took on them the Name and Habit of <hi>Paſtorelli,</hi> in imitation of thoſe in the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> who were warned by Angels to go to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> they had the <hi>Holy Lamb</hi> for their Enſign, and pretended to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence from <hi>Heaven</hi> to march into the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> but miſtaking <hi>West</hi> for the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> they ſhaped their courſe into <hi>France</hi> and committing ſeveral outrages that no way ſuited either with their Habit or Banner, they were incountred near <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux,</hi> and threeſcore Thouſand of them ſlain, and the reſt diſperſed.</p>
               <p>Things being now brought into a ſad and deplorable condition in <hi>Syria,</hi> without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hope of amendment, behold a ſtrange and unexpected accident revived them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain!

               <p>
                  <hi>Haalon</hi> having Conquered <hi>Perſia</hi> march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Babylon,</hi> the <hi>Caliph</hi> whereof called <hi>Musteazem,</hi> Idolized his wealth ſo much that he would not provide neceſſaries for the defence of the City, ſo that it became an eaſie Conqueſt to this <hi>Tartarian</hi> Prince, who having famiſhed the Covetous <hi>Caliph</hi> to death filled his mouth, with melted Gold, and now <hi>Moſques</hi> every where went down, and Churches went up, from thence he went into <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> where having

               <p>Whereupon entering <hi>Ptolemais</hi> they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled all the <hi>Genoans</hi> out of the City, pulled down their Buildings and plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all their Shops, and Warehouſes, but after a ten years War they were at laſt reconciled in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> by the Authority of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the fourth, tho' their War laſted longer in <hi>Italy.</hi>

                  <hi>Lewis</hi> being now on his way to <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> it was concluded by the general conſent of his Council, That for ſecuring the <hi>Christians</hi> paſſage to <hi>Syria,</hi> they ſhould firſt take the City of <hi>Carthage</hi> in <hi>Affrica,</hi> or rather <hi>Tunis,</hi> which being raiſed out of the Ruins of that famous City, was now become a Neſt of Pirates, who had killed and taken captive many Pilgrims, who were ſailing that way to the <hi>Holy Land.</hi> But no ſooner was the Siege began than the Plague ſeized on the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army, whereof Thouſands died, and among the reſt, <hi>Triſtram,</hi> King <hi>Lewis</hi>'s Son, and he himſelf of a Flux ſoon followed after.

               <p>But notwithſtanding this Mortality, the Siege was continued, and <hi>Tunis</hi> brought into ſuch diſtreſs, that they were glad to ſurrender the Town on theſe Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That they ſhould receive</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters freely to Exerciſe their Religion.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>And that they ſhould be at the whole charge of that Voyage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Prince <hi>Edward</hi> would have had the Town beaten down and all the Inhabitants put to the Sword, accounting the fouleſt Quarter too fair for ſuch Villains, and their Goods ſacrificed as an <hi>Anathema</hi> to God and burnt to aſhes, becauſe gotten by Robbery. But ſeeing he could not prevail with others, he reſolved however to ſhew his own deteſtation, by execrating his part of the Spoil, and cauſing it to be burnt, forbidding the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Soldiers to ſave any thing of it, telling them, that Coals ſtolen out of that Fire, would ſooner burn their Houſes than warm their Hands. It trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled not the conſcience of other Princes however, to inrich themſelves therewith and glut themſelves with the ſtolen Honey found in that Hive of Drones: And not only ſo, but terminated their Pilgrimage there too, refuſing to proceed any further therein. Whereat <hi>Edward</hi> aſtoniſhed, ſtruck his Hands on his Breaſt, and ſwore,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:37155:103"/>That tho' they all forſook him, yet he would enter <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> if accompanied with <hi>Fowin</hi> his Horſe-keeper only. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he arrived ſafe there, to the great comfort of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who were in ſore diſtreſs. Whilſt <hi>Theobald,</hi> King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> with the Queen, and the Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> died in their way home, and moſt of the Spoil was caſt away.</p>
               <p>At his arrival at <hi>Ptolemis,</hi> he found the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> juſt loſing their laſt ſtake, <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docdar</hi> having brought them to ſo low an ebb, that they had reſolved if ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected Succour reverſed not their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, within three days to reſign it up. But <hi>Edward</hi>'s coming in the interim, revived their hopes, and made them take Courage both to deſie their Enemies and their own thoughts of ſurrendring the City. Having ſufficiently victualed and manned <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> he marched with Six or Seven Thouſand Men to <hi>Nazareth,</hi> which he took, and ſlew thoſe he found therein. And being afterwards informed, that the <hi>Turks</hi> were gathered together at <hi>Cakhow,</hi> about Forty Miles from thence, he marched thither, and ſetting upon them early in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſlew a Thouſand of them, and put the reſt to flight. In which Battel, as well as in ſeveral other Skirmiſhes, he gave
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:37155:103"/>ſufficient proof of his own perſonal Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, ſlaying many of the Infidels in ſingle combat.</p>
               <p>After this Victory he returned to <hi>Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mais,</hi> where <hi>Elenor</hi> his Conſort was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of a fair Daugher, but the Joy occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned thereby was ſoon turned into Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, by the apprehenſion of his being mortally wounded by one of the Aſſaſſines, who reſorting to him ſeveral times with Letters and Meſſages from the Admiral of <hi>Joppa,</hi> who pretended a deſire to turn <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</hi> The firſt time of his coming, as the Prince was lying on his Bed and reading the Letters he brought, none being in the Room but them two, he ſuddenly ſtruck him into the Arm with an invenomed Knife, and attempted to have fetched ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther blow; but the Prince, whoſe Valour was now awakened, gave him ſuch a blow with his Foot, that he felled him to the ground, and wreſting the poyſoned Knife out of his hand, thruſt it into the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer's Belly and ſlew him; yet ſo that he hurt himſelf therewith in the Fore-head. It is ſtoried, that his Lady ſucked out all the venom of his Wounds, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicing her ſelf. But however, certain it is, that by the help of Phyſick, good Attendance, and an Antidote, the Maſter of the <hi>Templars</hi> gave him, he ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:37155:104"/>on Horſe back ſafe and well within fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days after.</p>
               <p>The Admiral hearing of his recovery, ſolemnly diſavowed his having any hand in the Treachery, it being ſeldom known that any will own themſelves the Parent of an unſucceeding Villany. And having done as much and more than could have been expected from ſo ſmall a number as he had with him, he returned home full fraught with Honour: And his Father, King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> being dead, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility met him as far as the <hi>Alpes,</hi> to attend him in his return home.</p>

               <p>And <hi>Alphir</hi> who was his next Succeſſor, underſtanding that the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> were at variance among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, reſolved to lay hold of that oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity as the fiteſt time finally to expel the <hi>Christians</hi> out of <hi>Palestine,</hi> and therefore coming out of <hi>Egypt</hi> with a great Army, he beſieged and won the Cities of <hi>Tripo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li, Sidon,</hi> and <hi>Berytus,</hi> and being incourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this Succeſs, he adventured to Beſiege <hi>Tyre</hi> it ſelf and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its invincible ſtrength, took it in a very ſhort time, and beat it down to the ground as he did the other three Cities.</p>
               <p>So that now there remained nothing of all that the <hi>Christians</hi> had won in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> but <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> which he might eaſily have taken, if he would have ſate down before with his Army, but he was unwilling to venture for fear, leaſt if he ſhould attempt the taking all from them at once, he might thereby alarum the <hi>Christian</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to repair thither for their Relief; and therefore concluded a Peace with the <hi>Venetians</hi> for five years, thinking that the bitter potion would be the more eaſily
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:37155:106"/>ſwallowed by them, if it were devided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two doſes.</p>

               <p>Beſides which there was at this time a great number of Pretenders, eagerly pro, ſecuting their ſeveral Titles to that City being no fewer then the <hi>Venetians, Geno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Piſans, Florentins,</hi> the King of <hi>Cyprus</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:37155:107"/>and <hi>Sicily,</hi> the Agents of the King of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> the Princes of <hi>Tripoli</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Maſter of the <hi>Templars</hi> and <hi>Hoſpitallers,</hi> and the Popes Legate, who would if he were now living think himſelf highly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed, in not being firſt named.

               <p>There was within the City at this time many new Pilgrims, who were lately come thither out of <hi>Europe,</hi> five hundred where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were of the Popes ſending, altho' he afterwards took no care for their Pay, for tho' he loved to ſee the Golden Tide flow into his Coffers, yet he could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to ſee it ebb again. But the ſoldiers being not paid reſolved according to their blunt but uſual cuſtom to pay themſelves, and therefore Marching out of the City Pillaged the Enemies Country, contrary to the Peace made with <hi>Alphir.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> demand ſatisfaction, which was not only denied by thoſe of <hi>Ptolomais,</hi> but their Embaſſadors likewiſe abuſed.</p>
               <p>Which ſo inraged Sultan <hi>Serapha</hi> (<hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phir</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Peter Belviſe</hi> Maſter of the <hi>Templars,</hi> a Valiant and Couragious General, being made Governour of the City by the gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al conſent of thoſe within, he incouraged the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to be Valiant, and play the Men and not like Prodigal Heirs part with the City for nothing, which coſt their Predeceſſors ſo much pains, and Blood to get, or at leaſtwiſe to make one Blaze of Valour before their Lamp ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, telling them, it would be a ſhame for them to ſhew their Friends their Faces, if they turned their Backs to their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and thefore exhorted them to fight it out manfully, that ſo if forced at laſt to ſurrender it they might rather be pittied for want of Fortune, then juſtly blamed for lack of Valour. And the City being now to wreſtle its laſt fall, he ſtripped it of all things that were comberſom and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſeful, for all the Women and Children
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:37155:108"/>and the Men too that were either aged or feeble, and had Mouths to eat and no Arms to fight he ſent away, retaining on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly twelve thouſand, which he conceived enough to defend the place notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vaſt number of the beſiegers.</p>
               <p>The Sultan Aſſaulted the City divers times with great Fury, but was ſtill beaten back by the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Artillery, and great numbers of the <hi>Turks</hi> killed, but in one of thoſe conflicts the undaunted Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our was unfortunately ſlain by a poyſoned Arrow; a loſs above grieving for, and the greater becauſe irreparable, many indeed were ſtrong in deſiring the Honour, but all too weak to diſcharge the Office; ſo that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> being devided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſeves neglected to defend the City, imagining that if it ſhould be taken, yet every Nation would be able to defend its part in regard their buildings were all fortified within themſelves, which idle and dangerous fancy took off their thoughts from minding the publick good, and fixed them only on their own private ends.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> at length taking the advant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of this Prepoſterous neglect, entred the City at a breach which they had made in the Wall, by undermining of it, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their work had then been done, tho'
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:37155:108"/>they quickly found to their coſt that it was but juſt begun, for to their aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and wonder, they found <hi>Ptolemais</hi> not a City but a great heap of Citys, as it were thrown together, the people of every Nation having ſo Fortified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their ſeveral Forts, that they didfrom thence Power forth whole vollies of ſhot upon the <hi>Turks,</hi> when they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Streets, which makes it a thing hardly to be paralell'd in Hiſtory, for a City to hold out ſo long after it was taken, for they bravely defended themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Whole <hi>Turkiſh</hi> power for fifty days together, and after all the reſt were ſubdued the Knights <hi>Hoſpitallers</hi> who all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways bore an implacable hatred to the <hi>Turks,</hi> maintained their Caſtle near a month long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but their unhappy deviſion render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them unable to ſubſiſt long, they were at length moſt of them ſlain, and the City wholy ſubdued by there numerous enemies.</p>
               <p>However it was a Bloody Victory to the Conquerour, moſt of thoſe who enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the City being burned with Fire, kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Arrows, or Smothered by the fall of Towers, of the very Ruins being as it were greedy of revenge, killed thoſe who deſtroyed them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ptolemais</hi> being now taken the Sultan thought it a good penyworth, tho' it coſt
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:37155:109"/>him ſo dear, and therefore to make ſure work and prevent all feuture occaſion of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting ſuch ſturdy Tennants, Levelled it even with the Ground.</p>
               <p>No fewer then an hundred thouſand <hi>Christians</hi> which were all the <hi>Latines</hi> that were left; fled at this time out of <hi>Paleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> into <hi>Cyprus,</hi> where they were freely entertained by <hi>Henry</hi> King of that Iſland and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to his great coſt but greater commendation.</p>
               <p>Five hundred Matrons and Virgins of Noble Blood, are by the Mirracle Mong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of that age, ſaid to ſtand on the ſhore of <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> with all their rich Jewels &amp; cry out with a lamentable voice for ſome body to Tranſport them from that dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous place, proffering any Marriner that would undertake it all their Wealth for his pains, and that he ſhould choſe out of them any one whom he beſt liked for a Wife, and that thereupon a certain Marriner came and Tranſported them all freely, Landing them ſafely in <hi>Cyprus.</hi> But when he was ſent for to receive his Hire, it could not by the ſtricteſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry be ever learnt who this Marriner was, or what became of him afterwards.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hoſpitallers</hi> were forced for haſt to leave their Treaſure behind them which they hid in a Vault, making it known
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:37155:109"/>from time to time to their Succeſſors. About three hundred years after it was fetch'd away by the Galleys of <hi>Malta.</hi>

For <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth King of <hi>England,</hi> towards the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of his Reign, purpoſed to have made a Voyage into <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> being told by ſome pretenders to the gift of Propheſie, that he ſhould not die tell he had heard Maſs in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but <hi>Henry</hi> was deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Voyage prevented by his dying ſoon after in a Chamber in his own Palace, at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> called by that name. And <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth King of <hi>France</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his return out of <hi>Italy,</hi> ſent a huffing Embaſſage to our <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he gave him to underſtand that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to make a ſecond conqueſt of <hi>Naples,</hi> with a deſign to make uſe of it as a bridge, to tranſport his Forces into <hi>Grecia,</hi> reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither to ſpare blood nor treaſure, altho' it were to the imparing of his Crown, and diſpeopling of his Kingdom, till he had either ruined the <hi>Ottaman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:37155:110"/>or taken it in his way to Par adice, (meaning the City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) but the <hi>French</hi> having had enough of the firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture for <hi>Naples,</hi> we never hear more of this threatned Voyage, to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is thought to be propounded, only to amuſe <hi>Henry</hi> till <hi>Charles</hi> ſhould have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed ſome projects he had then on foot, in the Dukedom of <hi>Britain,</hi> which deſign being ſcented by our King he uſed him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
               <p>More Cordial was the deſign of <hi>James</hi> the Fourth of <hi>Scotland,</hi> Who being touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in conſcience for his Fathers death (which tho' he did not procure, yet he ſeemed to countenance by his preſence) to expiate his Crime, intended a voyage to the <hi>Holy Land.</hi> In order whereunto he had prepared his Souldiers, and imparted his deſign to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein Princes, and had certainly gon had not other wars breaking out unexpectedly, and his own ſudden death prevented him.</p>
               <p>Among thoſe Overtures, we find one ſaid to be really performed by <hi>William Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi> of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> who with only Ninety eight Noble-men and Earls in his Company, made a Holy Voyage into <hi>Palestine,</hi> which he performed in Seven Months time. And upon his return, brought away with him Forty ſix Enſigns of Horſe, which he had taken from the <hi>Turks,</hi> with the loſs of one
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:37155:111"/>Man only, and he not ſlain neither, but died at <hi>Cyprus</hi> in their return home. A Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory ſo abſolute and bloodleſs to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, that were it true it would admit no parallel; but the Voyage and Victory were both fictitious, being found only in <hi>Calviſious,</hi> who quotes one <hi>Fab,</hi> an Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian no where to be met withal, for his Author; and the Chronology wherein it is recorded being Printed after the Author's death, it is moſt probable, that thoſe to whom the care of Printing it was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, found this ſtory in ſome Paper he had put in his Chronicle, and for the improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of it, marked it to be Fabulous; which word in regard he had written it defectively with the three firſt Letters only, they thought to have been ſome Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian whoſe Name was <hi>Fab,</hi> and ſo inſerted it in the Chronicle it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Ever ſince the huffing Embaſſy of <hi>Charles,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, the <hi>Holy War</hi> hath, for any thing I can find to the contrary, been wholly laid aſleep till revived again by the preſent Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>John Sobieski,</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> in the Year 1683. The occaſion whereof was briefly thus:</p>
               <p>The Grand Seignior having by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions of Count <hi>Teckeley,</hi> ſent an huge Army under the leading of the Grand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier, to invade the Imperial Territories in
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:37155:111"/>
                  <hi>Hugaria;</hi> againſt which the Duke of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi> who then commanded the Emperours Forces there, being not able to make head, they deſtroyed all before them with Fire and Sword; and paſſing forward, ſat down before <hi>Vienna,</hi> the Imperial City of <hi>Germany,</hi> not doubting but that they ſhould with their vaſt Army have quickly devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Important Place, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding its having been ever accounted the Bulwork of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> have added it to the reſt of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Conqueſt. The Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> ſeeing the ſad Eſtate to which things were now like to be reduced, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into a League offenſive and defenſive, and reſolved with their united Forces, to chaſtiſe the <hi>Turk</hi> for that proud Attempt.</p>
               <p>The Vizier's Army, wherewith he had now begirt <hi>Vienna,</hi> conſiſted of an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Fifty Thouſand Men, which were the very Flower of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery, wherewith he made ſeveral fierce Attacks upon the City, which were carried on with all the Courage and Skill imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and ſprang ſeveral Mines, whereby he did more miſchief, than by his Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Notwithſtanding which, the City, by the reſolution and encouragement of Count <hi>Starembergh,</hi> their undaunted Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, bravely defended it ſelf from the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:37155:112"/>fourteenth of <hi>July,</hi> till the twelfth of the following <hi>September,</hi> when the <hi>Turks</hi> were Forced to raiſe the Siege, and retire with great diſorder into <hi>Hungaria,</hi> whither they were ſo cloſely perſued by the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that very few of that nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Army eſcaped to carry the tidings, of their Overthrow to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Vaſt quantities of Proviſion and Amunition, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove an hundred pieces of Cannon, two <hi>Horſe Tayls,</hi> which the <hi>Turks</hi> allways uſe to hang out as a Denounciation of War, when ever they undertake any great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, all their Tents, which were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thirty thouſand in number, all the Enemies Baggage, together with the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers own Horſe, and the Grand Seignors <hi>STANDARD,</hi> which was extraordinary Rich and Sumptuous, being curiouſly Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered with charactars of Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, upon Green and Red Silk, were here taken by the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as Trophies of their Victory; the form and ſhape of the <hi>Standard</hi> you have here deſcribed in this fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure. The <hi>Infidels</hi> receiving likwiſe at the ſame time ſeveral great overthrows by the <hi>Sieur Kiniski,</hi> General of the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> who having ſlain about thirty thouſand <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Taratrs,</hi> entred the Country of <hi>Budzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ak</hi> deſtroying all before him, ſlaying an hundred thouſand of them, and taking the Cities of <hi>Bialogrod,</hi> and <hi>Ketin.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:37155:112"/>
               <p>The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> incouraged by theſe Victories reſolved to perſue them, and drive the <hi>Turks</hi> quite out of <hi>Europe,</hi> in order whereunto after they had taken the City of <hi>Tytchin,</hi> and ſeveral other places which the <hi>Turks</hi> held in Upper <hi>Hungaria,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lorraein</hi> inveſted <hi>Buda</hi> it ſelf with the greateſt part of the <hi>Imperial</hi> Army, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Count <hi>Leſlie</hi> to Encamp with the reſt, about <hi>Virovitzie,</hi> on the <hi>Drave,</hi> to cover the Siege. This City is the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt place the <hi>Turks</hi> injoy in <hi>Hungary,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing formerly the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, where the Kings of <hi>Hungary</hi> kept their Courts, but being taken from the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the Year 1591. By <hi>Solyman</hi> the Magnificent, Emperor of the <hi>Turks;</hi> they have ever ſince made it the ſeat and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant reſidence of their Chief <hi>Baſſa,</hi> or Vice-Roy of that part of <hi>Hungary,</hi> which is ſſpoſſeed by them, ſo that it is very popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and rich. And being exceedingly well fortified with a ſtrong built Wall, and an Invincible Caſtle, and having between 18 or 19 Thouſand Men in Gariſon, they have made a ſtout reſiſtance, and declared a reſolution to defend it to the laſt Man. Notwithſtanding which it is verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that it cannot hold out much long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but the <hi>Turks</hi> muſt be forced to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that City to the Emperor, after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing injoyed it near an hundred years.</p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:37155:113"/>
               <p>And that the <hi>Turk</hi> might be imployed on all ſides, the <hi>Venetians</hi> were invited like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe into this League againſt them, which they accepted of, and ſent out a brave fleet under the Command of their Generall <hi>Moroſini,</hi> to attack them at home, to whch Fleet the Pope and the Knights of <hi>Malta</hi> alſo joyned ſeveral of their Galleys, and ſo did the Duke of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> making in all forty ſix Galleys, ſix Gallieſſes, thirty three Men of War, twenty four Petaches, four Fire Ships, ſixteen Brigantines armed, and eighty two Galliots, on Board where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they had an Army of twenty five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men or upwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sancta Maria</hi> a ſtrong Fortreſs of great conſequence to the <hi>Turks,</hi> was the firſt place that felt the force of their victorious Arms, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quickly compelled to a ſurrender, they took their courſe towardsd <hi>Lepanto.</hi> And General <hi>Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeni</hi> concluding it neceſſary, for the maintaining the Conqueſt of <hi>Sancta Maria,</hi> to poſſeſs himſelf of <hi>Preveſe,</hi> a place of great importance in regard it is ſituated at the very entrance, and Commands the Gulf of <hi>Arta,</hi> reſolved to attempt it.</p>
               <p>Wherefore having Commanded five Galleys and ſix Gallieſſes, to approach towards the Caſtles of <hi>Gomenizze,</hi> not far from <hi>Preveſe,</hi> thereby to amuſe the <hi>Turks</hi> and oblige them to devide their Troops, by ſending reinforcements thither, which ſucceeded accordingly. For <hi>Saban</hi> Baſſà Governour of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſe,</hi> believing the <hi>Ventians</hi> deſigned to attack thoſe Caſtles, ſent thither the greateſt part of thoſe he had drawn together, for the ſecurity of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:37155:113"/>the Town. He brought his whole Fleet to an Anchor at the entrance of the Gulfe, and the next morning ordred Captain <hi>Menetta</hi> with twenty four Barks, and ſeveral Armed Brigantines to enter the Gulph, and land with part of the Forces under the Command of General <hi>Straſoldo.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected them to land where the Galleys had poſted themſelves, and had therefore imployed their Chief care on that ſide, now perceiving their error, immediately ſent away five hundred <hi>Spahees</hi> to charge them, but they having put themſelves into order of Battail, gave them ſo hot a welcome that many af them were ſlain, and the reſt fled in ſuch diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that they were moſt of them cut off, before they could reach the Town. Then the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> advancing, and having without oppoſition poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed themſelves of a Hill near the Town, the General ſent to ſummon it, but the Officer who cammanded it in the abſence of the Governour, (who was then abroad at the Head of a party of <hi>Turks,</hi> to obſerve the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and fancied they durſt not undertake the Siege of ſo ſtrong a place,) would not receive the Generals letter, but fired upon the Meſſenger that carried it; Whereupon four pieces of Cannon and as many Mortars were landed, and being placed upon a Battery, the next day about three hundred Bombs were ſhot into the Town, which burnt ſeveral Houſes, and before night all their Cannon were diſmounted, except one. The next day they Lodged themſelves in the Ditch, &amp; began to undermine the great Tower, whereupon twenty <hi>Turks</hi> made a ſalley in the night, &amp; ſurpriſed ſome of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which did but whet the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> Valour, and make them carry on their works with the greater eagerneſs and ſpeed, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Enemy plyed them very cloſe, with their ſmall ſhot. So that the Mine being ready and a conſiderable breach made in the Wall, order was
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:37155:114"/>given for a general aſault, but the <hi>Turks</hi> unwilling to run that hazzard, hung out a white flag and ſent five of their Principals to treat with the Gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, about ſurrendering the place. Who demanded the ſame conditions that were granted to the gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Sancta Maria,</hi> but the General would conſent to no other terms, then only to permit thirty of the moſt conſiderable of them to march out with their arms, and baggage, and the reſt without arms, taking with them what they could carry, which the <hi>Turks</hi> were forced to ſubmit to, and leave the Town to the Conqerours. The <hi>Turks</hi> by the loſs of this place, beſides the Town it ſelf loſt above 100000 Crowns, which they got yearly by the Fiſhery.</p>
               <p>This War may very well be parallel'd to the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and as Juſtly deſerves the Name of <hi>Holy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe in this War the Quarrel is between <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> as well as in that and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Wariours, is to Check the ſpreading of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Superſtition, as well as to put a ſtop to the progreſs of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Arms.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as the former was undertaken to wreſt from the <hi>Turks,</hi> what had been before injoyed by the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and free the Profeſſors of <hi>Chrſtianity</hi> from the Yoak of Infidelity, ſo was this.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as the former had the bleſſing of the Pope, and his <hi>Holineſs</hi>'s Contribution of money, and men for the carrying of it on, ſo had this &amp; therefore will without doubt be looked upon, by Succeeding ages, as an <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Religious War,</hi> which I hope will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have a Period, till <hi>Mahomets</hi> Tomb be tumbled down, and the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire overthrown.</p>
